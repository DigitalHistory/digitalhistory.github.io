General Description You do not have to become a coder to do well in this course. However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this second assignment, we&amp;rsquo;ll use one of the web&amp;rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work. We&amp;rsquo;ll then extend that knowledge with a set of slightly more advanced programming exercises.</description>
