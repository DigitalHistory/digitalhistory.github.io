Remember that the proper way to create your assignment repository is by clicking on this lick, allowing Github Classroom to do the work for you. (But you should already have done this for the last two assignments, and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t this assignment is probably not for you!)
As before, please make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled from the upstream repository before starting work on this assignment. See your own repo or the upstream Github Repo for details.</description>

      <description>Due Date: March 30
There is no new assignment link for the Oral History assignment; instead, you will just use the repository you have already cloned, or follow this old link to clone for the first time.
However, you will need to update some of the files in your repository to newer versions that I have since pushed to the main assignment repository. If you followed my instructions, you will not have made any changed to these files, so it should be trivial to pull in my changes by pasting these commands into the terminal (be sure you are in the root directory of your repository when issuing these commands):</description>

      <description>Due Date: Nov. 14, 2019
Your next assignment builds directly from our in-class exercise, and should be quite a bit easier to manage, technically, than your last assignment. Essentially, you will repeat the in-class assignment with much greater intellectual effort, but using the same technical framework. The assignment is now online.

General Description You do not have to become a coder to do well in this course. However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this second assignment, we&amp;rsquo;ll use one of the web&amp;rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work.</description>

      <description>General Description If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for History, Please, follow that link! Your job in this assignment is to tell the class a few things about yourself. In the process we&amp;rsquo;ll think about a few issues related to digital storage of information, including privacy, interpretation of sources, and data vs. knowledge.
One of the hardest parts of this course for many people is setting up their working environment. In this assignment you will be need to set up your working environment and then use Git, much as we did in class, but this time manipulating the command line.</description>
