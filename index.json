Discussion: how do you respond to information abundance? post-class period ONLY for students who failed the tests, or did not receive a mark  History in the age of scarcity  The members of prehistoric societies did not think they lived in prehistoric times. They merely lacked a good preservation medium. (Auerbach, quoted in Rosenzweig)\n   lots was going on, lots of continuity, lots we will never know b/c oral preservation is terrible at outliving a cultural tradition  \nScarcity  Historically, very little recorded Even less preserved historian\u0026rsquo;s task was to locate rare sources in faraway places  Implications  History skewed to those whose records appeared worth saving record always fragmentary  Historian free to fill in gaps  BUT: often possible to read large percentage of relevant sources  Age of Abundance  Tentative efforts are afoot to preserve our digital cultural heritage. If they succeed, historians will face a second, profound challenge\u0026#x2013;what would it be like to write history when faced by an essentially complete historical record?

Google, FB, and Twitter are preserving lots of data. As are Tesla and Samsung. But who will get to see it? How does a historian compete?\n\nProblems of Preservation  physical media software turnover \u0026amp; bitrot capturing dynamic/interactive media   \nWhat big data means for old documents  digitization does provide scale (or quantity) but does so at the price of rich, largely manual encoding. Visualization, customization, personalization, and similar analytical services increasingly familiar to us depend upon born-digital objects in which a great deal of structural and semantic knowledge has been encoded. The information captured on page images is, by contrast, implicit and often not directly accessible to the machines that will be always their first, often their only, and arguably their most important readers. (CILR)\n Can we tell stories? Can we do research?  no longer possible to read everything!  who will read it for us? How will we be experts? Can we automate our reading?  Narrative form ill-suited to massive quantities of data  can we develop new types of narratives?  Big questions may be answerable!

Abundance: Summary  \u0026ldquo;Abundance\u0026rdquo; offers many challenges  preservation interpretation access  Does history itself need to be reformed?  What relation to sources? What kinds of arguments? What narrative forms?   No Clothes, no body  It’s not that the emperor has no clothes(that would be fine); it’s that no one knows what the emperor looks like. (Ramsey 2010)\n  \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s one thing to worry that your canon isn\u0026rsquo;t sufficiently inclusive, or broad, or representative. It\u0026rsquo;s another thing when your canon has no better chance of being these thngs than a random selection. When we get up into the 14-million book range, books that are known by more than 2 living people are already \u0026ldquo;popular\u0026rdquo;\n\nDistant Reading: Abstract Models  \u0026#x2026;distance is however not an obstacle, but a specific form of knowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection. Shapes, relations, structures. Forms. Models.\n The opposite of close?  Dorothea, endowed with the extraordinary capacity for attentiveness that is \u0026ldquo;ardor,\u0026rdquo; is given to the strongest denunciations of the trivial, the most overwhelming anxieties of admitting the trivial into her life of any character in the novel. She is blind to the possibility that attention has the capacity to reveal that what seems trivial is in fact significant. She fears instead that the attention is wasted by devoting itself to those common objects which really are trivial, which have no redeeming significance:\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026#x2026;I should learn everything then,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, still walking quickly along the bridle road through the wood. \u0026ldquo;It would be my duty to study that I might help him the better in his great works. There would be nothing trivial about our lives. Everyday-things with us would mean the greatest things.\u0026rdquo;\n  to notice:\n analysis of passage longer than passage itself.  \nTo the point of deconstruction  If the pharmakon is ambivalent, it is because it constitutes the medium in which opposites are opposed, the movement and the play that links them among themselves, reverses them or makes one side cross over into the other (soul/ body, good/ evil, inside/ outside, memory/ forgetfulness, speech/ writing, etc.). The pharmakon is the movement, the locus, and the play: (the production of) difference. It is the différance of difference. It holds in reserve, in its undecided shadow and vigil, the opposites and the differends that the process of discrimination will come to carve out. Contradictions and pairs of opposites are lifted from the bottom of this diacritical, differing, deferring, reserve. Already inhabited by différance, this reserve, even though it precedes the opposition between different effects, even though it preexists differences as effects, does not have the punctual simplicity of a coincidentia oppositorum. It is from this fund that dialectics draws its reserves.\n Closeness  Literary study long organized around \u0026ldquo;close\u0026rdquo; reading \u0026ldquo;Hermeneutic\u0026rdquo; model of scholarship defines what it has meant to understand or master a text  Questioning Close Reading  But what is understanding? what is literature? what is the scholar\u0026rsquo;s goal?   \nSome Numbers  ~62,000 new Novels published in English in the US/year ~304,000 new and re-issued books in US/year ~129,000,000 books collected in world\u0026rsquo;s libraries    not possible to read these  can one still be an expert?   New forms of Understanding?  instead of, or in parallel with, close reading? apprehension of large-scale phenomena studying models, rather than texts themselves  Questions to consider  Does this count as comprehension? what new skills are required? What are the weaknesses of this form?  Graphs     condense data conceptualize mathematically convince readers a fundamentally rhetorical tool  \nMoretti\u0026rsquo;s Graphs    Quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations. (p.9)\n  yet, the graph is an argument: rise, fall, rise  A History of Readers    each phase a new \u0026ldquo;kind\u0026rdquo; of reader intensive, extensive, generic  Cycles  Event, cycle, longue durée: three time frames which have fared very unevenly in literary studies.\n\u0026#x2026; cycles constitute temporary structures within the historical flow. (p.14)\n  event \u0026rarr; close reading longue durée \u0026rarr; grand narrative cycle \u0026rarr; ?  Cycles in Literature    A genre exhausts its potentialities\u0026#x2026; when its inner form is no longer capable of representing the most significant aspects of contemporary reality. (p. 17, fn 7)\n Genre \u0026amp; Generation  \u0026#x2026; some kind of generational mechanism seems the best way to account for the regularity of the novelistic cycle\u0026#x2026; (p. 22)\n  \u0026ldquo;Normal literature\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;revolution\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;dying out\u0026rdquo;  From \u0026ldquo;the shift\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;a shift\u0026rdquo;    \u0026#x2026;the point is not who prevails in this or that skirmish, but exactly the opposite: no victory is ever definitive\u0026#x2026; the form keeps oscillating back and forth between the two groups. (p.29)\n Moretti\u0026rsquo;s method  \u0026#x2026;the real point here\u0026#x2026; is the total heterogeneity of problem and solution: to make sense of quantitative data, I had to abandon the quantitative universe, and turn to morphology: evoke form, in order to explain figures.\n  how justified is this move? what do we learn from it?  Maps  There is a very simple question about literary maps: what exactly do they do?\n  like graphs, maps are a persuasive tool What does it mean to \u0026ldquo;map\u0026rdquo; a novel?  What is a map?       What is a map?  abstract visual representation of a physical or imagined space  Moretti\u0026rsquo;s method      The form of an object is a \u0026lsquo;diagram of forces\u0026rsquo;, in this sense, at least that from it we can\u0026#x2026; deduce the forces that \u0026#x2026; have acted upon it. (p.57)\n Our Village  In the 1824 volume\u0026#x2026; the vilage was the undisputed centre of the surrounding countryside: the centripetal effects of the force \u0026ldquo;from within\u0026rdquo; were omnipresent, while the force \u0026ldquo;from without\u0026rdquo; was nowhere to be seen. (p. 57)\nTwo collections later, in 1828, the village\u0026rsquo;s gravitation field is already weaker\u0026#x2026; Something is wrong with the force from within, but as no counter-force challenges it yet, the basic pattern\u0026#x2026; remains in place. But by 1832\u0026#x2026; the village\u0026rsquo;s centripetal force is reduced to nothing, and the bulk of the book moves away\u0026#x2026; (p. 58-59)\n Our Village \u0026#x2013; Extremes     Modelling the text  reduce text to the model presume that sociological factors are determinative sustain focus on form (\u0026ldquo;a quantitative history of literature is also a profoundly formalist one\u0026rdquo; -p.25, fn 14) interpret model in light of theories  Trees     Moretti\u0026rsquo;s Evolutionism  Citations: Darwin, Feldman, Cavalli-Sforza In his genealogy: Karl Marx; H.

Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59evpoPsmdKhmB9YeqXMPg   Office Hrs: T Th 3-3:30, SS 3077   TA: Lara Howerton    \nIn general, online communication should take place via Slack. In the case of questions having to do with official University business (requests for extensions, discussion of accommodations, any message involving sensitive personal data) please use my University email, being sure to put \u0026ldquo;HIS393\u0026rdquo; in the subject line.\nIntroduction We all know \u0026#x2013; it is so commonplace that we barely even notice it! \u0026#x2013; that we are living through a revolutionary period in the history of communication. In the year of your birth, the World Wide Web was a scrawny, hand-powered frontier of hand-coded sites and Internet startups. Amazon and Google were infants. The University of Toronto Library website looked something like this:\n and many students and faculty still used the card catalog to find books in Robarts.\nToday, the processes of research, writing and reading are all dramatically transformed by information technology. Instead of painstakingly discovering rare books and manuscript artifacts, we can do full-text searches on a vast corpus. Our writing is mediated by immensely powerful computing machines, and our creations need not be limited exclusively to the linear texts around which all the humanities initially took shape. Readers encounter our writing, not as a few precious drops of information in a desert of ignorance, but as part of an endless stream of information that assaults them all day long.\nHow should history respond to these new conditions of our existence? In this class we explore foundational topics in the \u0026ldquo;digital humanities\u0026rdquo; and ask what we can learn from them about how we should be doing history \u0026#x2013; in particular, how we should be collecting, analyzing, synthesizing and presenting knowledge.\n How do the digital media developed in the last two decades change the way we understand history? Can the fundamental goal of interpreting the past survive? What, if any, new technical skills do we need to acquire? Can we use the new media to ask (and answer!) new kinds of questions? Can they help us improve our answers to the old questions? Perhaps most powerfully: how do the new digital conditions of existence relate to the question of \u0026ldquo;engaged\u0026rdquo; scholarship? What new opportunities, constraints, and dangers does digital production call forth when we mix scholarship and citizenship?  Objectives At the end of this course, you should:\n be able to describe to others what the phrase \u0026ldquo;digital humanities\u0026rdquo; means to you. be able to frame a coherent and nuanced argument of your own about the value of DH methods to the field of history be able to clearly state and defend a position regarding \u0026ldquo;engaged scholarship\u0026rdquo;, and articulate the relationship of your argument to the contemporary media landscape have a basic understanding of markup languages and their use in DH be able to make compelling use of media materials such as audio, video, and animation in historical arguments understand how to create simple historical maps, and have an opinion about the value of GIS in historical argument  Method There are many approaches to the digital humanities, all of them involving tools that are under rapid and iterative development. A given project is likely to require a substantial training period in the particular tools chosen by the principal investigators. It is therefore not possible for this course to provide an effective survey of \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; digital humanities toolkit. But learning tools is an essential skill for the digital humanist. So what should we do?\nAlmost every digital humanist will, at some point, need to do the following:\n read and edit HTML, CSS and Javascript debug running web pages using the browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in tools use a text editor to write code in any of several languages collaborate with peers using version control software, almost always git  Our emphasis is therefore on simple coding taught using standard tools that are available almost everywhere. Almost all of the software we use is Free or Open Source. You will learn very basic web development skills and slowly come to apply them to increasingly sophisticated (but still pretty simple!) historical questions. These baby steps will give you some sense of what skills a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; digital history project requires, and give you the tools you\u0026rsquo;ll need to teach yourself when you encounter new tools in the course of a project.\nPolicies Accessibility The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human Rights Code. For information on services and resources, see http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as\nRespecting Diversity Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of higher education. We expect you to be respectful of the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include, but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, technical ability, gender identity and presentation, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Please talk with me right away if you experience disrespect in this class—from any source, including myself—and I will active work to address it.\nCorrespondence As noted above, most communication should take place via Slack. In the case of questions having to do with official University business (requests for extensions, discussion of accommodations, any message involving sensitive personal data) please use my University email, being sure to put \u0026ldquo;HIS393\u0026rdquo; in the subject line. I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to reply within two working days, though occasionally the delay may be slightly longer. Please allow the full 48 hours to elapse before sending a repeat email.\nAlso: I have an injury-related difficulty co-ordinating action between my left and right hands, which leads to very frequent \u0026amp; distinctive typographical errors (and is also one of the many reasons you don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear me play a musical instrument). In my course materials, assignment comments, and announcements, I strive to eliminate those errors, but in instant messaging I am less attentive, as typing corrections approximately triples my composition time. So\u0026#x2026; please bear with me.\nAttendance Make every effort to attend each class meeting (including lab sections)! Class will begin and (usually) end on time. Please do your best to get to class before the start of the session. Students are expected to attend all meetings, with exceptions permitted in case of illness and family emergencies.\nPlease silence all cell phones/pagers/etc. before the beginning of each class. You should bring your laptop for in-class work, but please don\u0026rsquo;t use class time (lecture or lab) to check your email, update your Facebook, read reddit, watch YouTube, make dank memes, seize the means of production (well, that may be allowed under certain circumstances), etc. Such usage is distracting and interferes with learning both for you and for all the other students around you. If I notice you doing this, I will call you out in public. Spend class time on class materials. If another student\u0026rsquo;s activity is distracting, please ask them to stop it (or let me know outside of class).\nTools Course assignments will require you to install software. All of the software we use is free, but it requires a laptop to run. A Chromebook unfortunately will not be sufficient. While it is in principle possible to do all of your assignments on the web or using a very basic text editor, I do not recommend that method, and will not offer technical support. If you don\u0026rsquo;t own a laptop, you should find a way to borrow one, or buy a cheap model on College St to use for the duration of the semester.\nI can offer help with the following\n   Tool On Mac On Windows On Linux     Real Web Browser Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome   Text Editor VSCode VSCode VSCode   Bash Shell Environment Terminal (Built in) Git for Windows or Windows Subsystem for Linux gnome-terminal, qterm, etc   Git Version Control Git for OSX Git for Windows apt-get install git   Github Org Membership Sign up here Sign up here Sign up here   Git Visualization (optional!) gitKraken gitKraken gitKraken   Node and NPM Node Website (guide) Node Website (guide) Node Website (distro instructions)    Please see the Setup page for more details about the particular tools we will be using. YOU WILL ABSOLUTEY NEED TO HAVE THESE TOOLS IN ORDER TO TAKE THE COURSE\nCourse Requirements \u0026amp; Grading The assignments in this course take a wide variety of forms, and for the most part, differ significantly from what you\u0026rsquo;re likely to have encountered in other History courses. If you have little technical experience, or have perhaps ended up in this course by accident (!), you may find some of the work daunting at first. I have done my very best to make the assignments feasible for beginners, but you will likely encounter some difficult moments. I therefore strongly urge you to (1) start early! and (2) persevere through the difficult initial stages. The frustration you experience is, in fact, part of pedagogical method here. You are not expected to become a coding ninja, but learning how to learn is a major component of work in the Digital Humanities.\nBe warned! Marking in this course is unusual!\nGrading in this course is done using a modified point system. The system may seem odd at first, but it has definite advantages for both students and teachers, so don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated. Instead of receiving a number or letter grade for each assignment, and then getting a weighted sum of those grades as your final mark, you will choose what final mark to try for and then complete the assignments required for that mark. A certain set of assignments is required for a D; for a C, you must complete all of the \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; assignments plus another set; for a B, all of the C assignments plus some more; and the same goes for an A.\nHere are some more details:\n All Assignments Are Graded Pass/Fail Each assignment you get will include a careful explanation of my expectations. If your work meets those expectations, you get full credit; if not you get no credit. A \u0026lsquo;Passing\u0026rsquo; Mark on Assignments is a B+ In order to get credit for an assignment, you will have to demonstrate a high level of mastery \u0026#x2013; about the level normally required for a B+. Each Higher Grade Represents a quantum level of additional achievement As you move up the ladder, assignments test more advanced and difficult concepts from the course. If you fail, you can try again You start the semester with 5 \u0026lsquo;retry\u0026rsquo; chits, which you can use to resubmit assignments that have not succeeded. If necessary, you can use all of those chits on a single assignment! Resubmission process must be completed withing 1 week of the return date of the original version. A late assignment costs one \u0026lsquo;retry\u0026rsquo; chit There is no percentage penalty for late work; instead, a late paper will cost you one of your retry opportunities. Second and third tries get fewer comments I will give substantial comments on first tries; additional tries will get less and less fulsome commentary. Pluses and Minuses are determined by participation The only part of your grade which is not determined on a pass/fail basis is the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; part, which is assigned based on your on and offline participation. See the participation grade sheet for more details.  I know there will be questions! Please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to ask them. And here, finally, is the list of assignments.

I also have a very high opinion of Eloquent Javascript, but in past years students have often found it somewhat difficult. However, it rewards careful study, teaches excellent habits, and encourages creative thinking while coding. Both MDN and EJ have built-in JS Consoles forexperimenting with code (see below).\nMDN also has a more advanced guide to JavaScript which starts with this \u0026ldquo;reintroduction\u0026rdquo;. This can be worth consulting if you want more information.\nConsoles and Playgrounds Sometimes you will want to try out your code and test out your ideas before putting them in a permanent file. There are various tools for this.\n Browser consoles and scratchpads Your browser has a built-in \u0026ldquo;console\u0026rdquo; where you can enter javascript commands and see their output. See the Setup doc for more info. node console Unfortunately, VSCode does not have a built-in javascript console. However, you can easily create one in a terminal window by running the command node. Exit by typing Control-d or Control-c Control-c or .exit. VSCode Debugger VSCode has an excellent debugger. However, debugging is a complicated subject. If you want to try to use these tools, read the docs. VSCode extensions There are many excellent VSCode extensions for JavaScript. You can experiment with quokka, for instance. Online Playgrounds These can be fantastic resources, but they make more sense for web-based programming. We may discuss these later in the course.  "

However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this second assignment, we\u0026rsquo;ll use one of the web\u0026rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work. We\u0026rsquo;ll then extend that knowledge with a set of slightly more advanced programming exercises.\nWeb pages are composed of three components: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page; CSS controls the style of presentation; and Javascript permits dynamic modification of both. To explore the web from the inside, you need to be a little bit comfortable in all three.\nIn this assignment you will be introduced to HTML and CSS.

	"content": " As described in the syllabus, I use your participation mark to determine the \u0026ldquo;-/null/+\u0026rdquo; part of your grade. Let me explain a little more explicitly how this works.\nThe System It\u0026rsquo;s simple. Suppose you successfully complete all the main assignments, but decide not to write a Project Proposal. Congratulations! You have qualified for a B. But what kind of a B?\n   If your class participation was: You get a: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor B- 72   Satisfactory B 75   Excellent B+ 78    Similarly, perhaps you were only able to complete the Git \u0026amp; Github, HTML \u0026amp; CSS, Javascript and Oral History. Oops! You\u0026rsquo;re going to get a C. Like your somewhat happier classmate, your final grade will be assigned thus:\n   If your class participation was: You get a: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor C- 62   Satisfactory C 65   Excellent C+ 68    But Note!\nA+ is a special grade. Suppose you complete all the assignments satisfactorily, including the additional \u0026ldquo;A only\u0026rdquo; sections of the relevant assignments. Wow! You get an A, great. But\u0026#x2026; do you get an A+?\n   If your class participation was: You get an: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor A- 83   Satisfactory A 88   Excellent DEPENDS DEPENDS    Even if your participation was excellent, you will only receive an A+ if your work was consistently excellent and occasionally brilliant. So, if you successfully complete all the assignments (great!), and also are a great class participant (thanks!), then I\u0026rsquo;ll look over all your work and make a value judgment about whether you deserve this rare and precious grade.\nFinal Note for 2018 \u0026#x2013; this year, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; grade. To pass the course you basically have to get a C. In rare cases I will consider lowering the grading criteria for the \u0026ldquo;Oral History\u0026rdquo; assignment to permit a student to scrape through the course.\nParticipation Criteria Your participation mark is a combination of in-class and online participation.\nIn the Classroom But what makes for good class participation? You might want to start by reading How to discuss a book for history, which has lots of helpful suggestions. Really, please read it \u0026#x2013; it\u0026rsquo;s illuminating. But, meanwhile, here are some hints:\n Show up for class It\u0026rsquo;s hard to discuss when you\u0026rsquo;re not here. Do the Readings It\u0026rsquo;s hard to discuss what you haven\u0026rsquo;t read. I will try hard not to assign too much reading; in return, please try to read it. Be Courteous Treat your classmates with respect, even when your opinions differ fiercely. Refrain from interrupting others, notice when others have been waiting \u0026amp; let them speak first, and so on. Don\u0026rsquo;t shut other people down, and frame your comments in a way that invites further discussion. Listen Pay careful attention when your classmates are speaking; if their ideas seem a little unclear, try to fill in the gaps, either by thinking silently, or by asking friendly, clarifying questions. Try to think about how their positions relate to yours, and, especially, whether you should perhaps change your mind a little based on what they have to say. Be Clear think about the readings before you come to class, so that your opinions are well-formed. Be Brave It can be intimidating to speak in class, especially if you have found the readings or the lecture confusing. But you will almost never be alone. If one person is confused, others likely are too. Have the courage to speak up \u0026#x2013; everyone in the room is likely to thank you. If you are extremely shy in person, then come speak to me and we can try to work out a solution for you. Participate in Group work Occasionally we will break up into small groups. The same princples apply to group work \u0026#x2013; I\u0026rsquo;ll be paying attention.  Online Our Slack workspace is also a great way to participate. Contribute to the class in Slack by asking good questions, helping out your classmates, and correcting any professorial errors from lecture!\nFinally If you can do all of these things consistently, you\u0026rsquo;re likely to earn a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo;. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how you\u0026rsquo;re doing, come ask me in a couple of weeks and I\u0026rsquo;ll give you some feedback.\n"

	"content": " For the duration of this course, you will need to set up a \u0026ldquo;development environment\u0026rdquo; to do your work. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to download,install, and interact with a group of programs and services that make it possible to do your work. Setting your environment up can be difficult, so be sure to budget some time to do so! Also be aware that these tools will take up significant spae on your laptop and may cause your laptop to slow down somewhat if run simultaneously with\nPlatform Notes I run Arch Linux on my laptop, and have experience with Ubuntu as well. For the purposes of this class, I have installed Windows 10 Education Edition (available free to U of T students here). I wil also attempt to support MacOS as best I can.\n if you have an earlier edition of Windows, some of our tools may not work properly. I encourage you to upgrade to Windows 10 Education Edition, which has good support for modern tools. if you have a Chromebook, you will need to install a full Linux OS in order to do the coursework. Gallium OS and Crouton are the two recommended tools for this, and you can find some instructions here. Newer Chromebooks may support the new Linux Apps Beta installation, but I can\u0026rsquo;t test them. In the bast, Linux on a chromebook has not been easy, and I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help you. If this seems hard, you may want to think about buying an inexpensive, older laptop and installing an ordinary Linux distribution. Here are two lists of distributions, but the choice is up to you. .  Details Here\u0026rsquo;s the table of tools from the syllabus:\n   Tool On Mac On Windows On Linux     Real Web Browser Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome   Text Editor VSCode VSCode VSCode   Bash Shell Environment Terminal (Built in) Git for Windows or Windows Subsystem for Linux gnome-terminal, qterm, etc   Git Version Control Git for OSX Git for Windows apt-get install git   Slack Community Client Download, Signup Link Client Download, Signup Link Client Download, Signup Link   Github Org Membership Sign up here Sign up here Sign up here   Node and NPM Node Website (guide) Node Website (guide) Node Website (distro instructions)    If you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable exploring and installing software, you can probably get set up quickly by following the links above. Please nonetheless read the detailed instructions below. Things will go smoother if you do!\nWeb browser All of our work will involve interacting with the World Wide Web. Firefox and Chrome are head and shoulders above all other web browsers, and you should install one (or preferably both) of them. In class, I will use Firefox almost exclusively. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Firefox for a while, give the new Quantum version a try\u0026rsquo; it is much, much faster and more stable than its predecessors.\nBoth have highly sophisticated developer tools with which you should familiarize yourself. As you learn more about web design, you\u0026rsquo;ll come to rely on these tools more and more. Follow these links for more about Firefox Dev Tools and Chrome\u0026rsquo;s version.\nOf particular value in both Chrome and Firefox is the \u0026ldquo;Javascript Consoles,\u0026rdquo; accessible from the developer tools: Tools \\rightarrow Web Developer \\rightarrow Console or Menu \\rightarrow More Tools \\rightarrow Developer \\rightarrow Console\nThe Firefox console is a little awkward to use for multi-line programming, so they have also provided a \u0026ldquo;Scratchpad\u0026rdquo; tool (Shift-F4), which I find helpful, though I now use VSCode\u0026rsquo;s Javascript console instead (see \u0026ldquo;Text Editor\u0026rdquo;, below).\nThe other tool I use all the time is \u0026ldquo;inspect element\u0026rdquo;, available by right-clicking on any part of a web page. Both of these tools will prove essential for figuring out why your code isn\u0026rsquo;t working right!\nText Editor If you want to code, you have to write like a coder. This means using a powerful text editor. In this class we use Visual Studio Code. Please follow the download links and install to your computer. There\u0026rsquo;s a separate post about using VSCode \u0026#x2013; once you\u0026rsquo;ve installed it, navigate there!\nCommand Line Web developers and digital humanists spend a lot of their time in the command-line environment, interacting with their computers through text-based commands instead of a mouse or voice interface. It takes some time to learn to use the command-line, but it\u0026rsquo;s a very powerful and effective way to work once you get used to it. One goal of this course is to help you get comfortable in this environment and learn to take advantage of its power.\nThere are actually many different command-line environments; in this class we use bash, the most popular.\nOn Mac and Linux, bash is built in to the system. In Mac, open the Terminal app to find the bash prompt; in Linux you may have any of several terminal emulators installed, search your program list for \u0026ldquo;term\u0026rdquo; to find yours.\nIn Windows, bash comes with the Git installation \u0026#x2013; follow the instructions below. Note that very recent editions of Windows 10 come with the \u0026ldquo;Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\u0026rdquo;, which you can use instead of the Git Bash method.\nIMPORTANT UPDATE: VSCode has an integrated terminal, and it\u0026rsquo;s extremely useful. Windows users will have to do a little bit of work in order to use bash in the integrated terminal. See the excellent terminal configuration instructions online, and be sure to follow the link explaining how to access the user settings screen in VSCode.\nGit, Github, and optionaly GitKraken Software development is made vastly easier by \u0026ldquo;version control\u0026rdquo; systems: specialized software that keeps track of the history and current state of files and directories. In the past there were many such systems, but now almost the whole user uses git, and we\u0026rsquo;re all grateful for it.\nInstall Git To install git, follow the download links on the website (see the table above for OS-specific links and instructions). We\u0026rsquo;ll come back to the Git command-line in a minute.\nSign up for Github For many developers \u0026#x2013; maybe even most of them \u0026#x2013; using Git is intimately tied to the Github code-sharing website. We\u0026rsquo;ll be using Github for almost all of our work this semester, so it\u0026rsquo;s important that you get familiar with it. If you were present for the first class, you\u0026rsquo;ve already done this. If not, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to sign Up for a Github account. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you have two choices:\n practice working at the command line go straight to a GUI (\u0026ldquo;Graphical User Interface\u0026rdquo;) that will make working with git a little more comfortable.  I recommend at least trying the command line first.\nCommand-line Setup You need to tell git a little bit about yourself. Start with your email address and your user name. Open your bash shell (Terminal in Mac, git-bash in Windows) and type:\ngit config --global user.name \u0026quot;Your Name\u0026quot; git config --global user.email \u0026quot;youraddress@ mail.utoronto.ca\u0026quot; git config --global github.user YourGithubId  Great \u0026#x2013; now git knows who you are. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling ambitious, you can also set up SSH keys so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to type in your password every time you commit to Git.\nVSCode Git VSCode also has an interface to Git and Github. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty powerful and intuitive, so I recommend trying it before installing GitKraken. The instructions are here.\nUsing the GitKraken GUI client Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have a backp. GitKraken is an impressive visual tool that also makes it easy to configure all of your information. They have a nice video about SSH integration, which you can watch if you like.\nLearn more There is a somewhat more wordy Git tutorial on this website, which you should read. For now, Install the Github Desktop App which also includes the command-line version of git. You can follow the excellent tutorial in the downloadable git-it application, as well as the Github Desktop documentation. There is also a quite helpful tutorial on The Programming Historian. We\u0026rsquo;ll be discussing Git and Github further in our first class.\nNode and NPM \u0026#x2013; This is the hardest part! Right now it looks like the drag and drop tool we wanted to make will NOT be ready for this semester :frowning_face:\nInstalling Node is not strictly necessary for the first assignment. If you are having trouble, put this off till next week.\nMost of our programming work will involve Javascript, which runs most of the web. The Node.js environment and its \u0026ldquo;package manager,\u0026rdquo; NPM, are an incredible resource for Javascript development. In fact, Slack, VSCode, and gitKraken are all written as Node applications themselves! Installing the \u0026ldquo;bare\u0026rdquo; versions of node and NPM lets us access some of that power while we work.\nYou can survive this class without installing Node, but without it, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to run the test suites that accompany all of the assignments. You\u0026rsquo;ll therefore be at a disadvantage in the class, because the tests offer hints about what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with your code.\n In Mac and Linux, the instructions linked to in the table above are probably good enough. In Windows, you may follow all the instructions and then find yourself getting an error (\u0026rdquo;Command not found\u0026rdquo;). If that happens, you may want to try the instructions laid out here, or if you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows 10, you could go crazy and install the amazing Windows Subsystem for Linux, which allows you to work as if your computer had a real Unix operating system like everyone else.  The details of Node and NPM are a little outside the scope of our class, but a colleague at the University of Washington has an excellent introduction in one of his courses.\nSlack Slack is not strictly necessary to do your work, but it is the principal means of conversation for the class. Your activity in our Slack team is part of your participation assessment. So, please sign up for the team using the signup links above, and if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with Slack already, read some of the Slack documentation.\n"

	"content": " Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Visual Studio Code is an amazing general-purpose code editor. Most people I collaborate with use it as their primary editor, and that will be true in most professional settings you enter. This is the first year we\u0026rsquo;re using it in the class, and I have some high hopes for it.\nAs with any powerful tool, it can take a little while to get comfortable with VSCode. The documentation is excellent, but may sometimes assume more advanced programming skills than you have. The videos are also excellent and recommended.\nI will mostly let you explore on your own, but here are a few important starting points.\nEditor Basics   The editor has 4 main parts. Since each part can itself have lots of parts, this is not as simple as it sounds! From left to right, here are the main areas:\n the activity bar provides you with various tools and ways to switch views the side bar content changes depending on what you\u0026rsquo;ve selected in the activity bar. By default, it shows a file tree listing, like you would find in windows explorer or the Apple Finder. But it can also provide a list of extensions, information about your git status, or information about project tests, among other things. the editor groups are clusters of tabs. Usually a tab will contain a file, but things like the VSCode preferences and live HTML previews also show up in this area the panels near the bottom include the built-in terminal, a list of errors VSCode has found in your files, and other important tools  Also, the blue status bar on the bottom has clickable areas that let you interact with other editor features.\nFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to mention the Command Palette. This is a magic bar that opens up in the top center of the screen when you type F1 or Control-Shift-P (Command-Shift-P on a Mac). This gives you rapid access to many, many commands, and we\u0026rsquo;ll use it a lot.\nRead more about the user interface here.\nExtensions There are many, many amazing extensions to VSCode. I\u0026rsquo;ve chose a small number of them and bundled them into an extension pack. Install it by clicking on the extensions button in the activity bar and typing searching for History Hack Pack. Follow the links in the documentation to learn more about the individual extensions.\n"

	"content": " The Programming Historian link below is excellent. Having some trouble with screenshots ATM, will fix soon as I can reload my desktop \u0026#x2013; but for next few hours pls refer to the PH link for images!\nOne common issue for people new to the command line is that it can be tough to understand the notion of location in the filesystem. Most ordinary users interact with their filesystems through the so-called GUI layer \u0026#x2013; the graphical interface of windows. Often the user-accessible files are more or less restyricted to special directories (or \u0026ldquo;folders\u0026rdquo;) with meaningful names like Desktop, MyDocuments, etc. However, once you start working at the command line this convenient feature can become something of a curse. It\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize that these special locations are just part of a complex, hierarchical filesystem \u0026#x2013; a branching tree of directories and files, on which your operating system relies in many ways. You will need to learn to navigate that filesystem, not from the GUI, but from the command line.\nWhen you first start using the command line, it often feels (a) confusing and (b) somehow primitive or over-simple. The command line is, in fact, a sophisticated and incredibly efficient way to interact with the filesystem \u0026#x2013; but you need to learn your way around it first. In this class we won\u0026rsquo;t discuss the wonderful world of shell scripting (see below for guides to scripting); instead, I just want you to learn a few very basic commands to help you move around.\nNavigation The file system is a \u0026ldquo;branching tree\u0026rdquo; of files and folders. At the top (or bottom, depending on how you imagine things) of the tree is the \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;. In bash, we represent this as /. Every folder has a path that starts with / and proceeds down the file hierarchy. So, for instance, my global git configuration is located at /home/matt/.gitconfig. / is the root. /home/ is where all user files can be found. /home/matt/ contains all my user files. /home/matt/.gitconfig identifies the specific file I\u0026rsquo;m looking for.\nYour file explorer will represent this tree for you visually; you can also picture it schematically, as is done e.g. in the following image: We can also explore from the command line. Here are a few basic commands to learn for this purpose. [ Note: in the screenshots below, my command prompt is heavily customized and includes some extra information. Most notably, it tells me when I am in a git repository and gives me the name of the current git branch. You can experiment with changing your bash prompt in the ~/.bashrc file that controls many features of the\npwd pwd is short for \u0026ldquo;print working directory\u0026rdquo;, and will show you where you are in the file system. ls ls will list the contents of a directory. With no further arguments it will list the directory you\u0026rsquo;re currently in, but you can ask it to list some other directory too. Here are some examples. Note the \u0026ldquo;switches\u0026rdquo; -l and -la. Switches give further instructions to the command. In this case -l means \u0026ldquo;long\u0026rdquo; while -a is short for \u0026ldquo;all\u0026rdquo;. You can see in the screenshot below what the effect is. cd Short for \u0026ldquo;change directory\u0026rdquo;, cd allows you to move through the filesystem.\n cd someDirectoryName will move you into the subdirectory \u0026ldquo;someDirectoryName\u0026rdquo; of your current directory. cd with no arguments, or \u0026ldquo;cd ~ \u0026ldquo;, will drop you back into your home directory (this is helpful if you get lost somehow). At the command line, the tilde (~) is short for \u0026ldquo;home directory\u0026rdquo;, so you can use it anywhere instead of typing out your whole whome directory name. cd .. or cd ../ will move you \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; one level in the filesystem \u0026#x2013; so if you are currently in /home/matt/digitalHistory, executing cd .. will move you to /home/matt/.    cat and less Sometimes you want to look at the contents of a file. cat and less are two ways to do so. cat will print the contents of the file directly to your terminal window. less will create a simple interface that you can use to scroll through a longer file using a keyboard interface. mkdir and touch mkdir will create a new directory, while touch will create a new (empty) file.\nmkdir some-directory-name touch some-directory-name/somefile.txt  These commands will create the file somefile.txt in the folder some-directory-name, inside the current working directory.\nArrow Keys and Tab Expansion often we make mistakes typing or are unsure of spelling, etc. Two kinds of shortcuts make for huge time savings:\n arrow keys can be used to navigate through your previous commands \u0026#x2013; typing ↑ will reproduce your previous command, allowing you to correct any errors you might have made the last time you typed out some complex command and made a small error. Each time you type an ↑, you will move one command up in the command history. To get back down, type ↓. you can type TAB part way through a command to get a list of possible completions. If there\u0026rsquo;s only one possible command that starts with what you\u0026rsquo;ve typed so far, bash will complete it for you. Similarly, typing part of a file or directory name after a command has been entered will usually get you a list of possible completions. Try it a few times and you\u0026rsquo;ll see how much time it saves.  Learn More OK, that\u0026rsquo;s all for now, hopefully this helps you navigate around your projects. I may add to this guide as we go through the semester, but here are some further guides.\n this introduction is quite clear and simple the programming historian has a great guide too the TLDP guide introduced generations of programmers to bash scripting, and is still a useful reference point  "

	"content": "Node.js is an exquisite piece of programming infrastructure. One of its main features is support for developer-defined dependencies. As a programmer \u0026#x2013; or in my case, as a teacher \u0026#x2013; you can inform the underlying node package manager (npm) that your project \u0026ldquo;depends\u0026rdquo; on some group of other projects. This allows programmers to build constantly on each other\u0026rsquo;s work.\nIn our assignments, node dependencies are mostly used to enable the tests, whose main function is to help you figure out whether you\u0026rsquo;ve done the assignments correctly. Installing node dependencies is pretty simple, but can be confusing if you\u0026rsquo;re completely new to node, the command line, and programming in general. Here are the (very simple!) instructions:\n Install Node and NPM as per this section of the \u0026ldquo;Setup\u0026rdquo; instructions From the command line, navigate to the root directory of your repository using cd as per the navigation help page From the root directory of your repository,type the following command into the terminal/git-bash prompt: npm install  You should see some complex output from the command, after which your node dependencies will be installed. You can actually see the installed files by browsing the contents of the node_modules directory, which should now be present in your working directory.\nOnce the dependencies are installed, you should be able to run the node tests with npm test (issued from the same directory, that is, the root directory of your repository). If you\u0026rsquo;ve installed the VSCode extentions, ou\nI hope that helps!\n"

Why care about the Digital Age?  The World Out of Which We Come   The past is the world out of which we have come, the multitude of events and experiences that have shaped our conscious selves and the social worlds we inhabit. To understand how and why we live as we do, we cannot avoid appealing to the past to explain how andwhy we got to be this way. ([CrononWhyMatters2000], p. 4)    Not just Fact but Story   It is remembering and storytelling we care about, not the raw past, because only by being perennially resurrected in the mind of each ne generation does the past become meaningful. Only this does it become a living memory which in turn gives meaning to our present lives by reminding us ho we are\u0026#x2013;as individuals, as a state and nation, as a people.

Selector Anatomy  h1#anatomy1 { display: inline-flex; padding: 15px; background-color: rgb(30,30,30,0.1); font-size: 1.4em; border: 2px gray solid; } h1#anatomy1 span {padding: 4px;border: 2px black solid; background-color: rgba(10,70,10,0.6);} h1#anatomy1 span.selector {background-color: rgba(150, 20, 20, 0.4);} h1#anatomy1 span.rule {background-color: rgba(70, 10,70, 0.4);} h1#anatomy1 span.value {background-color: rgba(10,150, 150, 0.4);}  selector.has  #funny:stuff { rule: value in (approved); }   Selector types \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; h1 { font-size: 2em; color: red; } p { font-size:5em} .coolpara { color:green; } #myfave { color:yellow; background-color: black; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p class=\"coolpara\"\u0026gt;Some Content\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p id=\"myfave\"\u0026gt;Some Content\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;    Though simple in principle, CSS selectors can be confusing. Here are some basic selector types:  Element selectors: these just give the element (like h1, p, div, span, etc.). they apply to all elements of this type. Class selectors: these give the name of a class attribute that an HTML element may have. This selector will always begin with a period (\".\"). So for instance: ID selector: this addresses the element with a particular ID:    Selector types  div#cssdemo h1 { font-size: 3em; color: red; } div#cssdemo p { font-size:5em} .coolpara { color:green; } div#cssdemo #myfave { color:yellow; background-color: black; }   Heading Some Content\nSome Content\n  More Selectors div.main p { color:red; } div.main \u0026gt; p.blue { color: blue; }    Finally, we have many more complex selectors. This one here is a descendant selector   It addresses every p that is contained inside a div of class \"main.\"   More Selectors  div#cssmain p { color:red; } div#cssmain  p.blue { color: blue; }   regular (red) paragraph\nnot a regular paragraph (blue)     Selectors and the Cascade  Priority: inline \u0026rarr; id \u0026rarr; class \u0026rarr; element/tag fine gradations within this the awful !important rule     Color Values  Various representations:  ul#color-rules {font-size 1.5rem;} ul#color-rules li span.red {color: #FF0000} ul#color-rules li span.green {color: #00FF00} ul#color-rules li span.blue {color: #0000FF}   color: # 00 7F FF ;   color: rgb( 00, 127, 255 );   color: rgba( 00, 127, 255, 0.6);    (also hsl, hsla)  Fonts, colors and borders div.main { color: rgb(150,150,150); background-color: (#b0c4ee); text-align: center; text-decoration:underline; font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, Serif; font-style:italic; font-size:1.25em; border: 4px green solid; border-radius:20%; }    A lot of what we do with CSS is to set fonts and colors. Here are some examples: There are plenty of other properties that can be set, in much the same way.   Fonts and Colors in Action  div#maincss2 { color: rgb(150,150,150); background-color: (#b0c4ee); text-align: center; text-decoration:underline; font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, Serif; font-style:italic; font-size:1.25em; border: 4px green solid; border-radius:20%; }   here is a sample paragraph doing all of this stuff...\n   Sizes \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; p.fixed { font-size: 20px; background-color: gray; } p.em-small { font-size: 0.4em; background-color: blue; } p.em-big { font-size: 2.5em; background-color: red; } div.pixel-box { width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid black; } div.percent-box { width: 20%; height: 20px; border: 1px solid black; } div.viewport-box { width: 30vw; height: 30vh; border: 1px solid black; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p class=\"fixed\"\u0026gt;This paragraph will be syled differently from its peers\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p class=\"em-small\"\u0026gt;This paragraph will be syled differently from its peers\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p class=\"em-big\"\u0026gt;This paragraph will be syled differently from its peers\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\"pixel-box\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\"percent-box\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\"viewport-box\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;      Sizes  p.fixed { font-size: 20px; background-color: gray; } p.em-small { font-size: 0.4em; background-color: blue; } p.em-big { font-size: 2.5em; background-color: red; } div.pixel-box { width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid black; } div.percent-box { width: 20%; height: 20px; border: 1px solid black; } div.viewport-box { width: 30vw; height: 30vh; border: 1px solid black; }  This paragraph will be syled differently from its peers\nThis paragraph will be syled differently from its peers\nThis paragraph will be syled differently from its peers\n      Group Work: HTML  Let's continue our introduction to HTML in VSCode  Clone the excercse at the Github Repository   Here you can see the all parts of the page in different panes. try to add:  images lists real links anything else you can think of   Try to keep it \"real\", and work as teams, with one person driving, and the other person looking stuff up on another computer.

Part I: The Public Sphere  Authenticity in a media age  Figure 1: Jürgen Habermas   Mid-century anxiety Appearance of new media (radio, TV, new kinds of magazine) Are these \"degraded\"? Do the media make us stupider? Less critical? More pliable?   Reasons to worry       maybe there are material conditions that make this sort of evil possible? perhaps the media of communication have a role?    The Public Sphere   A portion of the public sphere comes into being in every conversation in which private individuals assemble to form a public body.  \u0026#x2013; J. Habermas    Habermas wants us to believe in the reality of the \"public sphere\", as a discursive body composed of conversations that have a certain form   Jürgen Habermas (b. 1929)  pre-eminent German public intellectual of 1960's and 1970's role of Holocaust/Fascism in all his thinking inheritance from the Frankfurt School search for \"authentic\" forms of communication   Concept of the Public Sphere   By \"the public sphere\" we mean\u0026#x2026; a realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed\u0026#x2026; Citizens behave as a public body when they confer in an unrestricted fashion \u0026#x2013; that is, with the guarantee of freedom of assembly and association and the freedom to express and publish their opinions \u0026#x2013; about matters of general interest. (Habermas 1964, p.49[p.2])   Unpacking:  \"something approaching public opinion\": suggests that \"public opinion\" has a technical meaning Conferring in an unrestricted fashion: the public sphere requires a certain kind of freedom Matters of general interest: we're not talking about breakfast, jeans, or lipstick.      Public and Private     Public Private     open to all restricted   accessible for money closed even if you can pay   state-related non-state, civil society   political non-political   official non-official   common special   impersonal personal   national or popular group, class, or locale   international/universal particular/finite   in view of others concealed   outside the home domestic   circulated in print/electronic media circulated orally/in manuscript   known widely known only to a few   acknowledged/explicit tacit/implicit     many definitions not all of them part of Habermas's terminology      Concept of the Public Sphere  Strukturwandlung der Öffentlichkeit (1962)  Arena ruled by rational argument Freedom of expression prevails (\u0026#x2026;an unrestricted fashion) Conversations concern common interests (e.g. ?) both ideal and historical arises first in 18th Century flourishes and then withers in 19th at a nadir in 20th; can it be revived?   Habermas's Habilitation and first important book. but 35 years old!!     Before Bourgeois Society  There is no \"Public Sphere\" Instead there are \"Public Individuals\" with certain powers  and Church authorities, empowered to speak on moral matters  Opposed to these are \"private persons\"   Begin the historical story w/ the classic trnasition to a bourgeois/capitalist society around 1800.  before this point, not public sphere, just public individuals, who are distinct from 'private persons\"    Private and Public Persons   A private person has no right to pass public and perhaps even disapproving judgement on the actions, procedures, laws, regulations, and ordinances of sovereigns and courts\u0026#x2026;. or to publish in print pertinent reports that he manages to obtain. For a private person is not at all capable of making such judgment, because he lacks complete knowledge of circumstances and motives.  \u0026#x2013; Frederick 'the Great' of Prussia, 1784   \"Private\" and \"Public\" distinguish types of person, not types of activity.     18th Century Origins  How do we get from a monarchy in which only 'public persons' have license to speak on 'public matters', to a 'public sphere' which is opened more widely?  Rise of newspapers/journals. Intrusion of private commentary on 'public' matters  a new kind of media  rise of salons \u0026amp; coffee houses.  a new kind of sociality.         Salons and Coffee Houses  Salons as the heart of intellectual activity in c. 18  'monopoly on first publication' mixing of classes freedom from patronage  Coffee Houses a similar space  But no restrictions on topics of discourse matters of politics as frequent a topic as art  an ideal of common humanity esp. in coffee houses  opinions judged by reason alone  no intrusion of 'distinction' or finance  [ but note: imperfection of this vision ]           one of the longstanding critiques of Habermas is the actual restrictiveness of coffee houses in real life. Who's excluded? make a list: women, the truly poor, non-Europeans, the uneducated (to some extent),   Circulation  Communication across broad spaces \u0026amp; differences needs something more than conversation need a way get ideas to large numbers  news sheets \u0026rarr; newspapers letters \u0026rarr; journals    Markets  Through newspapers \u0026amp; journals conversation becomes a commodity Therefore it loses its exclusivity so, in the beginning, commodification is a good thing   This process of commodification, and its trasformation from a positive, welcome force in to a troubling, destructive one is central to H but is not just his idea.     The State vs. Society  This is all happening in a pre-democratic era (mostly) 'The People' are a problem for the state growth of 'the social' a threat to sovereignty 'public sphere' precarious and subject to dissolution   The Structure of the Public Sphere      Private Realm Public Sphere Sphere of Public Authority     Civil Society (Commodity Exchange, social labour) Political Public Sphere State   Conjugal Family Literary/Philosophical Public Sphere Court     the public sphere sits between Private Life and Authority, striving for independence from both it mediates between them and draws its legitimacy from its use of reason note that it presupposes an emergent realm of \"privacy\" \u0026#x2013; and so, it is grounded in that notion, like all liberal philosophical constructs     From Debate to Consumption  Public Sphere in effect undoes itself success of media dissolves the reciprocal creation \u0026amp; communication of ideas  instead we just consume reason begins to vanish  Massive growth of media in c.20  radio, television, film  The Public Sphere: A Hollow Shell?  Where is its legitimacy?      Reception  extremely influential with some questions about both the historical and the philosophical elements of the story.   Counterpublics   \u0026#x2026;some publics are defined by their tension with a larger public\u0026#x2026; Discussion with such a public is understood to contravene the rules obtaining in the world at large\u0026#x2026; This kind of public is, in effect, a counterpublic: it maintains at some level\u0026#x2026; an awareness of its subordinate status. \u0026#x2013; M. Warner (2002)   One or Many?  Habermas sees Public Sphere as necessarily unitary But discourse carves out separate spaces  that may correlate with social divides \u0026#x2026; and where the addressee (\"stranger\") is presumed to share a common subordination with the speaker  (\"Given the fact that almost anyone can contribute to public discourse, the multiplicity of perspectives makes it even more difficult to define public opinion. Any designation of public opinion then becomes arbitrary\")   Disinterested or embodied?  for Habermas separation of individual from both \"accidental\" circumstances and official capacities is paramount Warner: This is fictive  and anyway undesirable  because some kinds of \"argument\" are fundamentally corporeal this doesn't make them less legitimate does it?     Reading or Acting  Habermas: the actions of a legitimate public sphere are actions of reading (scrutinize, judge, decide) Warner: in a counterpublic, there may be other sorts of actions (prance, diss, act up, fantasize, mourn)     How this matters for History  If there are many \"publics\", then working to carve out a particular space for discourse can have salutary effects Modes of address and standards of comportment can differ across 'publics' May even be possible to craft a 'public' around our work.  though \" it follows that the public exists only as long as the text is being engaged with\"    Enter the Internet  Habermas' theory revolves around a technology and a social institution  enabled by print, threatened by TV can the Internet undo this dissolution? If so, how? if not, is it the apotheosis of that dissolution?    Digital History and the Public Sphere  Does the Internet provide a space for authentic public conversatoin?

Some Variable Types  numbers strings boolean (true/false) arrays objects   Making Lists (Arrays) let historians= [\"Edward Gibbon\", \"Leopold von Ranke\", \"Edward Said\", \"Joan Scott\"];  undefined   brackets!   Working With Arrays a = []; a.push(\"Edward Gibbon\"); a.push(\"Edward Said\"); a.push(\"Joan Scott\"); console.log(a[1]); a.pop(); // a   push, pop, INDEX    Working with Numbers wardates=[1776, 1792, 1812, 1861, 1870, 1914, 1939, 1994] console.log(\"The time between The First and \\ Second World Wars was \" + (wardates[6] - wardates[5]) + \" years\");     Repetition: While Loops let historians= [\"Edward Gibbon\", \"Leopold von Ranke\", \"Edward Said\", \"Joan Scott\"]; let i = 0; while (i \u0026lt; historians.length) { console.log(historians[i] + \" was a historian.\"); i+=1; }   repeat inside the { ... } as long as test is true:  initial value: i = 0 test (halt condition): i \u0026lt; historians.length change in condition: i += 1     Repetition: For Loops let historians= [\"Edward Gibbon\", \"Leopold von Ranke\", \"Edward Said\", \"Joan Scott\"]; for (let i=0; i \u0026lt; historians.length ; i++){ console.log(historians[i] + \" was a historian.\"); i // this is not required, just here to show you a slight difference }   initial value: i = 0 test (halt condition): i \u0026lt; historians.length change in condition: i++ (idiomatic)     Repetition: other for loops    let historians= [\"Edward Gibbon\", \"Leopold von Ranke\", \"Edward Said\", \"Joan Scott\"]; for (i in historians) { console.log(historians[i] + \" was a historian.\"); } for (let h of historians) { console.log(h + \" was a historian.\"); }   these also \"loop\" but the initial value, test, and increment are implicit defined by historians, but in slightly different ways. they are very convenient! read about them.     Conditionals: If let historians= [\"Edward Gibbon\", \"Leopold von Ranke\", \"Edward Said\", \"Joan Scott\"]; let i = 0; while (i \u0026lt; historians.length) { if (historians[i] === \"Joan Scott\") { console.log(historians[i] + \" is my favourite.\"); } i +=1; };   execute the { ... } only if the test is true here the test is historians[i] === \"Joan Scott\" note the many === \u0026#x2013; different from just one =   Branching let historians= [\"Edward Gibbon\", \"Leopold von Ranke\", \"Edward Said\", \"Joan Scott\"]; let i = 0; while (i \u0026lt; historians.length) { if (historians[i] ===\"Joan Scott\") { console.log(historians[i] + \" is my favourite.\"); } else { console.log(historians[i] + \", meh.\"); } i +=1; };     Doing Stuff: functions  A Function is a variable(!)  functions are also a box into which you put stuff but when you look into the box, the \"stuff\" has changed we use them to change the state: to do things use whenever you're repeating an action or process compare:   let fruit=\"orange\"; eat(\"orange\") let e = eat(f)   Defining a function function square(number) { return number * number; } let cube = function(number) { return number * number * number; }; console.log(square(2)); console.log(cube(3));   we'll use the first method:  keyword function followed by name then (parameters, if, you, need, them), then { , then statements, then }    name parameters definition return value    Remember this let historians= [\"Edward Gibbon\", \"Leopold von Ranke\", \"Edward Said\", \"Joan Scott\"]; let i = 0; while (i \u0026lt; historians.length) { console.log(historians[i] + \" was a historian.\"); i+=1; }   As a function function makeSentences(historians) { let i = 0, output = \"\"; while (i \u0026lt; historians.length) { output += historians[i] + \" was a historian.\\n\"; i+=1; } return output; } let h1 = [\"Edward Gibbon\", \"Leopold von Ranke\", \"Edward Said\", \"Joan Scott\"], h2 = [\"Orlando Patterson\", \"Michel Foucault\", \"Natalie Zeemon Davis\", \"Howard Zinn\"]; makeSentences(h1); //makeSentences(h2);   Finally we can talk about scope! let a = \u0026#39;just some string\u0026#39;, b = \u0026#39;some other string\u0026#39;; function scopeExample (anyString) { let a = \u0026#39;I set this value inside the function\u0026#39;; return (\u0026#39;inside the function, a=\"\u0026#39; + a + \u0026#39;\", not \u0026#39; + anyString); } // a // scopeExample(a); //anyString   outside the function, a = \"just some string\" inside, we redeclare it for the function scope and now a has new value anyString is only declared inside the function scope   Advanced scope let a = \"global scope a\"; console.log(a); for (i=0; i\u0026lt;6; i++) { let a = \"local scope a on iteration: \" + (i + 1) ; console.log(a) } console.log(a);   we can also redeclare let variables in an if/for/while \"block\" scope scales: global \u0026rarr; function \u0026rarr; block \u0026rarr; nested block \u0026rarr; etc etc any time you see { .. } you're in a new scope context!   Function Hints for Assignments  remember the return values!  debug by setting a variable to the function output, and using quokka to look at the value: function returnArray (first, second, third) { // you can define the array using \"new Array ()\" or just \"[ , , ]\" // don\u0026#39;t forget to return it // return ; // add the value here! } let a = returnArray (1, 3,5); a // quokka will display the value    Function note 1: Name vs. Return Value  A Function is a variable Robot function robotCleaner () { let output = \"I cleaned your room\"; return output; } let r = robotCleaner(); a   build a function to do something name it whatever you want the return value is what the function \"give you back* call it whenever you need it done   Name and Return Value are independent function robotCleaner () { let output = `Ha, ha! I have replaced your robot cleaner! Now your room is even messier! Bwa ha ha ha ha!` return output; } let a = robotCleaner(); a   To pass the assignment, always modify the function don't get confused and try to somehow modify the function call no intrinsic relationship between name and return value   Functions note 2: Parameter and Output  Your Return Value should Make use of the Parameter function greatWriter (name) { let output = \"Margaret Atwood was a great writer.\" return output } console.log(greatWriter(\"Margaret Atwood\")) // console.log(greatWriter(\"Toni Morrison\"))   Solution: don't use a STATICALLY DEFINED STRING as your output function evenGreaterWriter (name) { let output = name + \" was a great writer.\" return output } console.log(evenGreaterWriter(\"Margaret Atwood\")) // console.log(evenGreaterWriter(\"Toni Morrison\"))     Parts of things: elements, methods, properties let a=[\"name\", 0, \"otherinfo\"]; console.log(a[2]); console.log(a.length); console.log(a[length]); a.pop;   note strange syntax:  a[1]: second element of array a.length: a special way of finding the length of any array.

Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength.  Plan for the day  Problems of Abundance Distant Reading: a method for textual overload? Discussion: how do you respond to information abundance? post-class period ONLY for students who failed the tests, or did not receive a mark     History in the age of scarcity   The members of prehistoric societies did not think they lived in prehistoric times. They merely lacked a good preservation medium. (Auerbach, quoted in Rosenzweig)   lots was going on, lots of continuity, lots we will never know b/c oral preservation is terrible at outliving a cultural tradition    Scarcity  Historically, very little recorded Even less preserved historian's task was to locate rare sources in faraway places   Implications  History skewed to those whose records appeared worth saving record always fragmentary  Historian free to fill in gaps  BUT: often possible to read large percentage of relevant sources     Age of Abundance   Tentative efforts are afoot to preserve our digital cultural heritage. If they succeed, historians will face a second, profound challenge\u0026#x2013;what would it be like to write history when faced by an essentially complete historical record? (Rosenzweig)   completely different situation than we used to have!    Abundance  much more recorded than in the past vastly more preserved, at least for now increasing percentage of historical works as well   Mechanical Speech  auto-preservation but by and for whom?   Google, FB, and Twitter are preserving lots of data. As are Tesla and Samsung. But who will get to see it? How does a historian compete?   Problems of Preservation  physical media software turnover \u0026amp; bitrot capturing dynamic/interactive media     What big data means for old documents   digitization does provide scale (or quantity) but does so at the price of rich, largely manual encoding. Visualization, customization, personalization, and similar analytical services increasingly familiar to us depend upon born-digital objects in which a great deal of structural and semantic knowledge has been encoded. The information captured on page images is, by contrast, implicit and often not directly accessible to the machines that will be always their first, often their only, and arguably their most important readers. (CILR)   Can we tell stories? Can we do research?  no longer possible to read everything!  who will read it for us? How will we be experts? Can we automate our reading?  Narrative form ill-suited to massive quantities of data  can we develop new types of narratives?  Big questions may be answerable!  What used to be pure speculation, can perhaps now be made more concrete and compelling  How does role of religion in public discourse change over time? how do railroads impact social and economic development? others?       Abundance: Summary  \"Abundance\" offers many challenges  preservation interpretation access  Does history itself need to be reformed?  What relation to sources? What kinds of arguments? What narrative forms?      No Clothes, no body   It’s not that the emperor has no clothes(that would be fine); it’s that no one knows what the emperor looks like. (Ramsey 2010)   \"It's one thing to worry that your canon isn't sufficiently inclusive, or broad, or representative. It's another thing when your canon has no better chance of being these thngs than a random selection. When we get up into the 14-million book range, books that are known by more than 2 living people are already \"popular\"     Distant Reading: Abstract Models   \u0026#x2026;distance is however not an obstacle, but a specific form of knowledge: fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection. Shapes, relations, structures. Forms. Models.   The opposite of close?   Dorothea, endowed with the extraordinary capacity for attentiveness that is \"ardor,\" is given to the strongest denunciations of the trivial, the most overwhelming anxieties of admitting the trivial into her life of any character in the novel. She is blind to the possibility that attention has the capacity to reveal that what seems trivial is in fact significant. She fears instead that the attention is wasted by devoting itself to those common objects which really are trivial, which have no redeeming significance:  \"\u0026#x2026;I should learn everything then,\" she said to herself, still walking quickly along the bridle road through the wood. \"It would be my duty to study that I might help him the better in his great works. There would be nothing trivial about our lives. Everyday-things with us would mean the greatest things.\"   to notice:  analysis of passage longer than passage itself.    To the point of deconstruction   If the pharmakon is ambivalent, it is because it constitutes the medium in which opposites are opposed, the movement and the play that links them among themselves, reverses them or makes one side cross over into the other (soul/ body, good/ evil, inside/ outside, memory/ forgetfulness, speech/ writing, etc.). The pharmakon is the movement, the locus, and the play: (the production of) difference. It is the différance of difference. It holds in reserve, in its undecided shadow and vigil, the opposites and the differends that the process of discrimination will come to carve out. Contradictions and pairs of opposites are lifted from the bottom of this diacritical, differing, deferring, reserve. Already inhabited by différance, this reserve, even though it precedes the opposition between different effects, even though it preexists differences as effects, does not have the punctual simplicity of a coincidentia oppositorum. It is from this fund that dialectics draws its reserves.   Closeness  Literary study long organized around \"close\" reading \"Hermeneutic\" model of scholarship defines what it has meant to understand or master a text   Questioning Close Reading  But what is understanding? what is literature? what is the scholar's goal?     Some Numbers  ~62,000 new Novels published in English in the US/year ~304,000 new and re-issued books in US/year ~129,000,000 books collected in world's libraries   not possible to read these  can one still be an expert?    New forms of Understanding?  instead of, or in parallel with, close reading? apprehension of large-scale phenomena studying models, rather than texts themselves   Questions to consider  Does this count as comprehension? what new skills are required? What are the weaknesses of this form?     Graphs   condense data conceptualize mathematically convince readers a fundamentally rhetorical tool   Moretti's Graphs     Quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations. (p.9)   yet, the graph is an argument: rise, fall, rise   A History of Readers    each phase a new \"kind\" of reader intensive, extensive, generic   Cycles   Event, cycle, longue durée: three time frames which have fared very unevenly in literary studies.  \u0026#x2026; cycles constitute temporary structures within the historical flow. (p.14)   event \u0026rarr; close reading longue durée \u0026rarr; grand narrative cycle \u0026rarr; ?   Cycles in Literature     A genre exhausts its potentialities\u0026#x2026; when its inner form is no longer capable of representing the most significant aspects of contemporary reality. (p. 17, fn 7)   Genre \u0026amp; Generation   \u0026#x2026; some kind of generational mechanism seems the best way to account for the regularity of the novelistic cycle\u0026#x2026; (p. 22)   \"Normal literature\" but \"revolution\" as \"dying out\"   From \"the shift\" to \"a shift\"     \u0026#x2026;the point is not who prevails in this or that skirmish, but exactly the opposite: no victory is ever definitive\u0026#x2026; the form keeps oscillating back and forth between the two groups. (p.29)   Moretti's method   \u0026#x2026;the real point here\u0026#x2026; is the total heterogeneity of problem and solution: to make sense of quantitative data, I had to abandon the quantitative universe, and turn to morphology: evoke form, in order to explain figures.   how justified is this move? what do we learn from it?     Maps   There is a very simple question about literary maps: what exactly do they do?   like graphs, maps are a persuasive tool What does it mean to \"map\" a novel?   What is a map?        What is a map?  abstract visual representation of a physical or imagined space   Moretti's method       The form of an object is a 'diagram of forces', in this sense, at least that from it we can\u0026#x2026; deduce the forces that \u0026#x2026; have acted upon it. (p.57)   Our Village   In the 1824 volume\u0026#x2026; the vilage was the undisputed centre of the surrounding countryside: the centripetal effects of the force \"from within\" were omnipresent, while the force \"from without\" was nowhere to be seen. (p. 57)  Two collections later, in 1828, the village's gravitation field is already weaker\u0026#x2026; Something is wrong with the force from within, but as no counter-force challenges it yet, the basic pattern\u0026#x2026; remains in place. But by 1832\u0026#x2026; the village's centripetal force is reduced to nothing, and the bulk of the book moves away\u0026#x2026; (p. 58-59)   Our Village \u0026#x2013; Extremes      Modelling the text  reduce text to the model presume that sociological factors are determinative sustain focus on form (\"a quantitative history of literature is also a profoundly formalist one\" -p.25, fn 14) interpret model in light of theories     Trees      Moretti's Evolutionism  Citations: Darwin, Feldman, Cavalli-Sforza In his genealogy: Karl Marx; H. G. Wells; E. O. Wilson; all of evolutionary psychology   Plots    Clues as evolved phenomenon  Doyle as canonical starting point for detective fiction But has a context; how to describe? note: not a personal context!   Styles    Free Indirect Style   A peculiar mix of indirect and direct discourse, which draws the verbal tenses and pronouns from the former, and the tone and the order of the sentence from the latter:  It was the abode of noise, disorder, and impropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought to be. She could not respect her parents, as she had hoped.   Why FIS?  appears to mark a major social transformation (\"halfway btwn the social doxa and the individual voice, FIS is a good indicator of their changing balance of forces\")  Moretti's goal: to quantitatively (?) trace these forces   Take a form, follow it from space to space, and study the reasons for its transformations: the 'opportunistic, hence unpredictable' reasons of evolution.    Problematics  Teleological thinking? dealing with the \"twisted branching\"? is this really \"quantitative\"? Does this qualify as \"insight\"?

Language is our second nature  Gadamer argues that we never know a historical work as it originally appeared to its contemporaries.

Trying, as the earlier hermeneuticians did, to locate the (scientific) value of the humanities in their capacity for objective reconstruction is bound to be a wasted effort.

How to avoid?  D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) if done right, guarantees that low-level problems only need to be solved once remember: laziness is a virtue      Writing \"Atomic\" Functions  Complex code is difficult to debug! instead, try to make your individual functions as simple as possible divide your problem into smallest possible parts (hence 'atomic') \"chain\" your functions together to recreate complexity much easier to localize failure     Making a card deck \u0026lt;card class=\"card\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Person Name\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;main class=\"card\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; lengthy text here \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/main\u0026gt; \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\"https://digitalhistory.github.io/\"\u0026gt;A Project of HIS393\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/card\u0026gt;    let sampleData = { name: \u0026#39;Person Name\u0026#39;, blurb: \u0026#39;lengthy text here\u0026#39;, };   Task: given a JSON data structure, generate a set of cards (like the ones we made in assignment 0, but simpler)   First, Map the assignment  card deck \u0026rarr; set of cards card \u0026rarr; \u0026lt;card\u0026gt;\u0026lt;header\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/header\u0026gt;\u0026lt;main\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/main\u0026gt;\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;\u0026lt;card\u0026gt; this is set of tagged elements so we might do something like this:  fn 1: tag some content fn 2: use fn 1 to make header structure fn 3: use fn 1 to make main structure fn 4: use fn 1 to make footer structure fn 5: use fn 2, fn 3, fn 4 to make sub-structures and then call fn 1 to wrap whole thing fn 6: loop through data structure, calling fn 5 once for each element    Start with Fn 1: letsTag function letsTag(a,c,b={}){output=`\u0026lt;${c} `;Object.keys(b).map((k,i)=\u0026gt;output+=`${k}=\"${b[k]}\" `);output+=`\u0026gt;${a}\u0026lt;/${c}\u0026gt;`;return output} letsTag(\u0026#39;I am the main content\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;main\u0026#39;, {style: \u0026#39;border: 2px solid black;\u0026#39;});   code is purposely obfuscated; you guys can perhaps discuss among yourselves how you would implement it (is slightly harder than your assignment)   Fn 2: headMe() function letsTag(a,c,b={}){output=`\u0026lt;${c} `;Object.keys(b).map((k,i)=\u0026gt;output+=`${k}=\"${b[k]}\" `);output+=`\u0026gt;${a}\u0026lt;/${c}\u0026gt;`;return output} function headMe (titleText) { let output=letsTag(titleText, \u0026#39;h1\u0026#39;); output=letsTag(output, \u0026#39;header\u0026#39;); return output } headMe(\u0026#39;I am the title\u0026#39;);   All the Rest function letsTag(a,c,b={}){output=`\u0026lt;${c} `;Object.keys(b).map((k,i)=\u0026gt;output+=`${k}=\"${b[k]}\" `);output+=`\u0026gt;${a}\u0026lt;/${c}\u0026gt;`;return output} function footMe () { let link = letsTag(\u0026#39;A Project of HIS393\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, {href: \u0026#39;https://digitalhistory.github.io/\u0026#39;}); return letsTag(link, \u0026#39;footer\u0026#39;); } function mainMe (blurb) { let p = letsTag(blurb, \u0026#39;p\u0026#39;); return letsTag(p, \u0026#39;main\u0026#39;); } function cardMe (person) { let header = headMe(person.name); let main = mainMe(person.blurb); let footer = footMe(); return letsTag(header + main + footer, \u0026#39;card\u0026#39;, {class: \u0026#39;card\u0026#39;}); } function makeAllTheCards (people) { output = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; for (p of people) { output += cardMe (p); } return $(\u0026#39;main#page-main\u0026#39;).append(output); } makeAllTheCards (allEntries);         // Full list of configuration options available here: // https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration Reveal.initialize({ controls: true, progress: true, history: true, center: false, slideNumber: 'c', rollingLinks: false, keyboard: true, mouseWheel: false, fragmentInURL: false, hashOneBasedIndex: false, pdfSeparateFragments: true, overview: true, width: \"100%\", height: \"100%\", margin: 0.10, minScale: 1.00, maxScale: 1.00, theme: Reveal.getQueryHash().theme, // available themes are in /css/theme transition: Reveal.getQueryHash().transition || 'convex', // see README of reveal.js for options transitionSpeed: 'default', // Optional libraries used to extend reveal.js dependencies: [ {src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/klipse_reveal.js'}, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }] });    /* Recompute layout upon changes by klipse.

How do maps \u0026amp; media transform the kinds of stories we can tell     Looking at Whales  impressive data collection arresting images but conclusion is about pillage: not immediately apparent to the eye.   One version of the story      Lying with Maps  maps are rhetorical objects use of shade, color, can be very misleading same numbers can produce very different visualizations   birth rates        \"Critical\" Cartography  if maps \"lie\", or, at least, if maps are arguments, then:  what relations of power do they reveal/participate in? if we are aware of the \"lying\", how can we work with it critically?
