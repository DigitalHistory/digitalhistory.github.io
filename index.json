	"content": "Due Date: May 15\nGeneral Description You do not have to become a coder to do well in this course. However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this second assignment, we\u0026rsquo;ll use one of the web\u0026rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work. We\u0026rsquo;ll then extend that knowledge with a set of slightly more advanced programming exercises.\nWeb pages are composed of three components: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page; CSS controls the style of presentation; and Javascript permits dynamic modification of both. To explore the web from the inside, you need to be a little bit comfortable in all three.\nIn this assignment you will be introduced to HTML and CSS. The detailed assignment README leads you through a series of skill-building exercises, and provides links to comprehensive tutorial resources. As always, ask for help on Slack; use the new #blog-assignment channel for support/collaboration.\nhere is the assignment repo-creation link!!\nRubric   Passes General Tests\n  Passes Reflection Tests\n    "

	"content": "Just a few words about JSON format. The format of the assignments JSON file will make more sense after we\u0026rsquo;ve learned a little bit of JavaScript (in the next 3 weeks). For this assignment I\u0026rsquo;m not really asking you to understand the format, but you do have to obey the syntax rules or the assignment tests will fail. JSON is a portable data format used for moving data from one source to another. It is what is called a \u0026ldquo;key-value datastore\u0026rdquo; – a JSON file consists of \u0026ldquo;keys\u0026rdquo;, or names, and associated \u0026ldquo;values\u0026rdquo;. The relationship is represented by a : – os a single key-value pair is written as key: value.\nWhat I wrote above is almost true. However, there are a few more rules to follow:\n in JSON, the key name must be enclosed in double quotation marks the value must be either a plain number, the special words true or false, or any sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks (actually, it\u0026rsquo;s more complicated than that, but for this assignment let\u0026rsquo;s not say any more) key-value pairs are separated from each other by commas the whole JSON object must be surrounded by curly braces  So a real JSON file – the model for what you must produce – will look like this:\n{ \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Korra\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nickName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Avatar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;privateName\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;picture\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Korra_The_Legend_of_Korra.jpg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;privatePicture\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;korra_avatar@@utoronto.ca\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;privateEmail\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;github\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;korra\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;privateGithub\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;superpower\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Master of All Four Elements\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;academicinterests\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Comparative Ancient Greek and Chinese Cosmology; Conservation Principles in Physical and Religious Systems\u0026#34; } MOST STUDENTS MAKE SYNTAX ERRORS WHEN THEY ARE STARTING OUT.

	"content": "For the duration of this course, you will need to set up a \u0026ldquo;development environment\u0026rdquo; to do your work. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to download, install, and interact with a group of programs and services that make it possible to do your work. Setting your environment up can be difficult, so be sure to budget some time to do so! Also be aware that these tools will take up significant spae on your laptop and may cause your laptop to slow down somewhat if run simultaneously with\nPlatform Notes I run Arch Linux on my laptop, and have experience with Ubuntu as well. For the purposes of this class, I have installed Windows 10 Education Edition (available free to U of T students here). I wil also attempt to support MacOS as best I can.\n if you have an earlier edition of Windows, some of our tools may not work properly. I encourage you to upgrade to Windows 10 Education Edition, which has good support for modern tools. if you have a Chromebook, you will need to install a full Linux OS in order to do the coursework. Gallium OS and Crouton are the two recommended tools for this, and you can find some instructions here. Newer Chromebooks may support the new Linux Apps Beta installation, but I can\u0026rsquo;t test them. In the bast, Linux on a chromebook has not been easy, and I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help you. If this seems hard, you may want to think about buying an inexpensive, older laptop and installing an ordinary Linux distribution. Here are two lists of distributions, but the choice is up to you. .  Details Here\u0026rsquo;s the table of tools from the syllabus:\n   Tool On Mac On Windows On Linux     Real Web Browser Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome   Text Editor VSCode VSCode VSCode   Bash Shell Environment Terminal (Built in) Git for Windows or Windows Subsystem for Linux gnome-terminal, qterm, etc   Git Version Control Git for OSX Git for Windows apt-get install git   Slack Community Client Download, Signup Link Client Download, Signup Link Client Download, Signup Link   Github Org Membership Sign up here Sign up here Sign up here   Node and NPM Node Website (guide) Node Website (guide) Node Website (distro instructions)    If you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable exploring and installing software, you can probably get set up quickly by following the links above. Please nonetheless read the detailed instructions below. Things will go smoother if you do!\nWeb browser All of our work will involve interacting with the World Wide Web. Firefox and Chrome are head and shoulders above all other web browsers, and you should install one (or preferably both) of them. In class, I will use Firefox almost exclusively. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried Firefox for a while, give the new Quantum version a try\u0026rsquo; it is much, much faster and more stable than its predecessors.\nBoth have highly sophisticated developer tools with which you should familiarize yourself. As you learn more about web design, you\u0026rsquo;ll come to rely on these tools more and more. Follow these links for more about Firefox Dev Tools and Chrome\u0026rsquo;s version.\nOf particular value in both Chrome and Firefox is the \u0026ldquo;Javascript Consoles,\u0026rdquo; accessible from the developer tools: Tools \\rightarrow Web Developer \\rightarrow Console or Menu \\rightarrow More Tools \\rightarrow Developer \\rightarrow Console\nThe Firefox console is a little awkward to use for multi-line programming, so they have also provided a \u0026ldquo;Scratchpad\u0026rdquo; tool (Shift-F4), which I find helpful, though I now use VSCode\u0026rsquo;s Javascript console instead (see \u0026ldquo;Text Editor\u0026rdquo;, below).\nThe other tool I use all the time is \u0026ldquo;inspect element\u0026rdquo;, available by right-clicking on any part of a web page. Both of these tools will prove essential for figuring out why your code isn\u0026rsquo;t working right!\nText Editor If you want to code, you have to write like a coder. This means using a powerful text editor. In this class we use Visual Studio Code. Please follow the download links and install to your computer. There\u0026rsquo;s a separate post about using VSCode – once you\u0026rsquo;ve installed it, navigate there!\nCommand Line Web developers and digital humanists spend a lot of their time in the command-line environment, interacting with their computers through text-based commands instead of a mouse or voice interface. It takes some time to learn to use the command-line, but it\u0026rsquo;s a very powerful and effective way to work once you get used to it. One goal of this course is to help you get comfortable in this environment and learn to take advantage of its power.\nThere are actually many different command-line environments; in this class we use bash, the most popular.\nOn Mac and Linux, bash is built in to the system. In Mac, open the Terminal app to find the bash prompt; in Linux you may have any of several terminal emulators installed, search your program list for \u0026ldquo;term\u0026rdquo; to find yours.\nIn Windows, bash comes with the Git installation – follow the instructions below. Note that very recent editions of Windows 10 come with the \u0026ldquo;Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\u0026quot;, which you can use instead of the Git Bash method.\nIMPORTANT UPDATE: VSCode has an integrated terminal, and it\u0026rsquo;s extremely useful. Windows users will have to do a little bit of work in order to use bash in the integrated terminal. See the excellent terminal configuration instructions online, and be sure to follow the link explaining how to access the user settings screen in VSCode.\nGit, Github, and optionally GitKraken Software development is made vastly easier by \u0026ldquo;version control\u0026rdquo; systems: specialized software that keeps track of the history and current state of files and directories. In the past there were many such systems, but now almost the whole user uses git, and we\u0026rsquo;re all grateful for it.\nInstall Git To install git, follow the download links on the website (see the table above for OS-specific links and instructions). We\u0026rsquo;ll come back to the Git command-line in a minute.\nSign up for Github For many developers – maybe even most of them – using Git is intimately tied to the Github code-sharing website. We\u0026rsquo;ll be using Github for almost all of our work this semester, so it\u0026rsquo;s important that you get familiar with it. If you were present for the first class, you\u0026rsquo;ve already done this. If not, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to sign Up for a Github account. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you have two choices:\n practice working at the command line go straight to a GUI (\u0026ldquo;Graphical User Interface\u0026rdquo;) that will make working with git a little more comfortable.  I recommend at least trying the command line first.\nCommand-line Setup You need to tell git a little bit about yourself. Start with your email address and your user name. Open your bash shell (Terminal in Mac, git-bash in Windows) and type:\ngit config --global user.name \u0026#34;Your Name\u0026#34; git config --global user.email \u0026#34;youraddress@ mail.utoronto.ca\u0026#34; git config --global github.user YourGithubId Great – now git knows who you are. If you\u0026rsquo;re feeling ambitious, you can also set up SSH keys so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to type in your password every time you commit to Git.\nVSCode Git VSCode also has an interface to Git and Github. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty powerful and intuitive, so I recommend trying it before installing GitKraken. The instructions are here.\nUsing the GitKraken GUI client Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have a backp. GitKraken is an impressive visual tool that also makes it easy to configure all of your information. They have a nice video about SSH integration, which you can watch if you like.\nLearn more There is a somewhat more wordy Git tutorial on this website, which you should read. For now, Install the Github Desktop App which also includes the command-line version of git. You can follow the excellent tutorial in the downloadable git-it application, as well as the Github Desktop documentation. There is also a quite helpful tutorial on The Programming Historian. We\u0026rsquo;ll be discussing Git and Github further in our first class.\nNode and NPM – This is the hardest part! Right now it looks like the drag and drop tool we wanted to make will NOT be ready for this semester :frowning_face:\nInstalling Node is not strictly necessary for the first assignment. If you are having trouble, put this off till next week.\nMost of our programming work will involve Javascript, which runs most of the web. The Node.js environment and its \u0026ldquo;package manager,\u0026rdquo; NPM, are an incredible resource for Javascript development. In fact, Slack, VSCode, and gitKraken are all written as Node applications themselves! Installing the \u0026ldquo;bare\u0026rdquo; versions of node and NPM lets us access some of that power while we work.\nYou can survive this class without installing Node, but without it, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to run the test suites that accompany all of the assignments. You\u0026rsquo;ll therefore be at a disadvantage in the class, because the tests offer hints about what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with your code.\n In Mac and Linux, the instructions linked to in the table above are probably good enough. In Windows, you may follow all the instructions and then find yourself getting an error (\u0026ldquo;Command not found\u0026rdquo;). If that happens, you may want to try the instructions laid out here, or if you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows 10, you could go crazy and install the amazing Windows Subsystem for Linux, which allows you to work as if your computer had a real Unix operating system like everyone else.  The details of Node and NPM are a little outside the scope of our class, but a colleague at the University of Washington has an excellent introduction in one of his courses.\nSlack Slack is not strictly necessary to do your work, but it is the principal means of conversation for the class. Your activity in our Slack team is part of your participation assessment. So, please sign up for the team using the signup links above, and if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with Slack already, read some of the Slack documentation.\n"

	"content": "Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Visual Studio Code is an amazing general-purpose code editor. Most people I collaborate with use it as their primary editor, and that will be true in most professional settings you enter. This is the first year we\u0026rsquo;re using it in the class, and I have some high hopes for it.\nAs with any powerful tool, it can take a little while to get comfortable with VSCode. The documentation is excellent, but may sometimes assume more advanced programming skills than you have. The videos are also excellent and recommended.\nI will mostly let you explore on your own, but here are a few important starting points.\nEditor Basics   The editor has 4 main parts. Since each part can itself have lots of parts, this is not as simple as it sounds! From left to right, here are the main areas:\n the activity bar provides you with various tools and ways to switch views the side bar content changes depending on what you\u0026rsquo;ve selected in the activity bar. By default, it shows a file tree listing, like you would find in windows explorer or the Apple Finder. But it can also provide a list of extensions, information about your git status, or information about project tests, among other things. the editor groups are clusters of tabs. Usually a tab will contain a file, but things like the VSCode preferences and live HTML previews also show up in this area the panels near the bottom include the built-in terminal, a list of errors VSCode has found in your files, and other important tools  Also, the blue status bar on the bottom has clickable areas that let you interact with other editor features.\nFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to mention the Command Palette. This is a magic bar that opens up in the top center of the screen when you type F1 or Control-Shift-P (Command-Shift-P on a Mac). This gives you rapid access to many, many commands, and we\u0026rsquo;ll use it a lot.\nRead more about the user interface here.\nExtensions There are many, many amazing extensions to VSCode. I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen a small number of them and bundled them into an extension pack. Install it by clicking on the extensions button in the activity bar and typing searching for History Hack Pack. Follow the links in the documentation to learn more about the individual extensions.\n"

	"content": "Logistics    Instructor: Matt Price     Email: matt.price@utoronto.ca   Meeting Times T Th 10-12 EST via BB Collaborate   Web: http://digitalhistory.github.io/   Slack: https://digitalhistoryuoft.slack.com/   Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59evpoPsmdKhmB9YeqXMPg   Office Hrs: T Th 3-3:30, SS 3077    In general, online communication should take place via Slack. In the case of questions having to do with official University business (requests for extensions, discussion of accommodations, any message involving sensitive personal data) please use my University email, being sure to put \u0026ldquo;HIS393\u0026rdquo; in the subject line.\nIntroduction We all know – it is so commonplace that we barely even notice it! – that we are living through a revolutionary period in the history of communication. In the year of your birth, the World Wide Web was a scrawny, hand-powered frontier of hand-coded sites and Internet startups. Amazon and Google were infants. The University of Toronto Library website looked something like this:\n and many students and faculty still used the card catalog to find books in Robarts.\nToday, the processes of research, writing and reading are all dramatically transformed by information technology. Instead of painstakingly discovering rare books and manuscript artifacts, we can do full-text searches on a vast corpus. Our writing is mediated by immensely powerful computing machines, and our creations need not be limited exclusively to the linear texts around which all the humanities initially took shape. Readers encounter our writing, not as a few precious drops of information in a desert of ignorance, but as part of an endless stream of information that assaults them all day long.\nHow should history respond to these new conditions of our existence? In this class we explore foundational topics in the \u0026ldquo;digital humanities\u0026rdquo; and ask what we can learn from them about how we should be doing history – in particular, how we should be collecting, analyzing, synthesizing and presenting knowledge.\n How do the digital media developed in the last two decades change the way we understand history? Can the fundamental goal of interpreting the past survive? What, if any, new technical skills do we need to acquire? Can we use the new media to ask (and answer!) new kinds of questions? Can they help us improve our answers to the old questions? Perhaps most powerfully: how do the new digital conditions of existence relate to the question of \u0026ldquo;engaged\u0026rdquo; scholarship? What new opportunities, constraints, and dangers does digital production call forth when we mix scholarship and citizenship?  Objectives At the end of this course, you should:\n be able to describe to others what the phrase \u0026ldquo;digital humanities\u0026rdquo; means to you. be able to frame a coherent and nuanced argument of your own about the value of DH methods to the field of history be able to clearly state and defend a position regarding \u0026ldquo;engaged scholarship\u0026rdquo;, and articulate the relationship of your argument to the contemporary media landscape have a basic understanding of markup languages and their use in DH be able to make compelling use of media materials such as audio, video, and animation in historical arguments understand how to create simple historical maps, and have an opinion about the value of GIS in historical argument  Method There are many approaches to the digital humanities, all of them involving tools that are under rapid and iterative development. A given project is likely to require a substantial training period in the particular tools chosen by the principal investigators. It is therefore not possible for this course to provide an effective survey of \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; digital humanities toolkit. But learning tools is an essential skill for the digital humanist. So what should we do?\nAlmost every digital humanist will, at some point, need to do the following:\n read and edit HTML, CSS and Javascript debug running web pages using the browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in tools use a text editor to write code in any of several languages collaborate with peers using version control software, almost always git  Our emphasis is therefore on simple coding taught using standard tools that are available almost everywhere. Almost all of the software we use is Free or Open Source. You will learn very basic web development skills and slowly come to apply them to increasingly sophisticated (but still pretty simple!) historical questions. These baby steps will give you some sense of what skills a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; digital history project requires, and give you the tools you\u0026rsquo;ll need to teach yourself when you encounter new tools in the course of a project.\nCourse Format (CoViD edition) This class is being taught online and largely asynchronously for the first time during lockdown in May/June 2020. Despite being organized around Digital History,the class has, ironically, traditionally relied heavily on face to face interactions. This term, lectures will all be delivered asynchronously, and scheduled classtime – 4 hours per week – will be devoted to practical coding and writing problems. Essentially, this is a flipped classroom approach, but one in which we never meet IRL. If you\u0026rsquo;re not able to come to the live sessions, help will also be available through Slack and other async channels.\nEach week, I will post a series of short lectures online. You will be expected to watch them in advance of our class meetings, and we will use the meeting time to practice skills you\u0026rsquo;ll need for the assignments.\nPlease use this BB Collab to join our class meetings. This first week is a trial run – we will see if BB Collaborate works for us, and reassess if necessary.\nPolicies Accessibility The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human Rights Code. For information on services and resources, see http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as\nRespecting Diversity Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of higher education. We expect you to be respectful of the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include, but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, technical ability, gender identity and presentation, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Please talk with me right away if you experience disrespect in this class—from any source, including myself—and I will active work to address it.\nCorrespondence As noted above, most communication should take place via Slack. In the case of questions having to do with official University business (requests for extensions, discussion of accommodations, any message involving sensitive personal data) please use my University email, being sure to put \u0026ldquo;HIS393\u0026rdquo; in the subject line. I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to reply within two working days, though occasionally the delay may be slightly longer. Please allow the full 48 hours to elapse before sending a repeat email.\nAlso: I have an injury-related difficulty co-ordinating action between my left and right hands, which leads to very frequent \u0026amp; distinctive typographical errors (and is also one of the many reasons you don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear me play a musical instrument). In my course materials, assignment comments, and announcements, I strive to eliminate those errors, but in instant messaging I am less attentive, as typing corrections approximately triples my composition time. So… please bear with me.\nAttendance Make every effort to attend each class meeting if you can! Class will begin and (usually) end on time. Please do your best to get to class before the start of the session. Students are expected to attend all meetings unless lockdown-related scheduling issues prevent you. Please let me know in advance if you need to skip class either once or in general.\nPlease silence notirications on your devices during class, so you can focus. . You should bring your laptop for in-class work, but please don\u0026rsquo;t use class time (lecture or lab) to check your email, update your Facebook, read reddit, watch YouTube, make dank memes, seize the means of production (well, that may be allowed under certain circumstances), etc. Such usage is distracting and interferes with learning both for you and for all the other students around you. If I notice you doing this, I will call you out in public. Spend class time on class materials. If another student\u0026rsquo;s activity is distracting, please ask them to stop it (or let me know outside of class).\nTools Course assignments will require you to install software. All of the software we use is free, but it requires a laptop to run. A Chromebook unfortunately will not be sufficient. While it is in principle possible to do all of your assignments on the web or using a very basic text editor, I do not recommend that method, and will not offer technical support. If you don\u0026rsquo;t own a laptop, you should find a way to borrow one, or buy a cheap model on College St to use for the duration of the semester.\nI can offer help with the following\n   Tool On Mac On Windows On Linux     Real Web Browser Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome   Text Editor VSCode VSCode VSCode   Bash Shell Environment Terminal (Built in) Git for Windows or Windows Subsystem for Linux gnome-terminal, qterm, etc   Git Version Control Git for OSX Git for Windows apt-get install git   Github Org Membership Sign up here Sign up here Sign up here   Git Visualization (optional!) gitKraken gitKraken gitKraken   Node and NPM Node Website (guide) Node Website (guide) Node Website (distro instructions)    Please see the Setup page for more details about the particular tools we will be using. YOU WILL ABSOLUTEY NEED TO HAVE THESE TOOLS IN ORDER TO TAKE THE COURSE\nCourse Requirements \u0026amp; Grading The assignments in this course take a wide variety of forms, and for the most part, differ significantly from what you\u0026rsquo;re likely to have encountered in other History courses. If you have little technical experience, or have perhaps ended up in this course by accident (!), you may find some of the work daunting at first. I have done my very best to make the assignments feasible for beginners, but you will likely encounter some difficult moments. I therefore strongly urge you to (1) start early! and (2) persevere through the difficult initial stages. The frustration you experience is, in fact, part of pedagogical method here. You are not expected to become a coding ninja, but learning how to learn is a major component of work in the Digital Humanities.\nBe warned! Marking in this course is unusual!\nGrading in this course is done using a modified point system. The system may seem odd at first, but it has definite advantages for both students and teachers, so don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated. Instead of receiving a number or letter grade for each assignment, and then getting a weighted sum of those grades as your final mark, you will choose what final mark to try for and then complete the assignments required for that mark. A certain set of assignments is required for a D; for a C, you must complete all of the \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; assignments plus another set; for a B, all of the C assignments plus some more; and the same goes for an A.\nHere are some more details:\n All Assignments Are Graded Pass/Fail Each assignment you get will include a careful explanation of my expectations. If your work meets those expectations, you get full credit; if not you get no credit. A \u0026lsquo;Passing\u0026rsquo; Mark on Assignments is a B+ In order to get credit for an assignment, you will have to demonstrate a high level of mastery – about the level normally required for a B+. Each Higher Grade Represents a quantum level of additional achievement As you move up the ladder, assignments test more advanced and difficult concepts from the course. If you fail, you can try again You start the semester with 5 \u0026lsquo;retry\u0026rsquo; chits, which you can use to resubmit assignments that have not succeeded. If necessary, you can use all of those chits on a single assignment! Resubmission process must be completed withing 1 week of the return date of the original version. A late assignment costs one \u0026lsquo;retry\u0026rsquo; chit There is no percentage penalty for late work; instead, a late paper will cost you one of your retry opportunities. Second and third tries get fewer comments I will give substantial comments on first tries; additional tries will get less and less fulsome commentary.

	"description": "",
	"content": "You may find it useful, as you prepare for the next assignment, to read the following post!\nWhat is Popcorn Popcorn is a Javascript \u0026ldquo;library\u0026rdquo; – a small collection of programs – that lets web designers key events in a web page to a time-code in a media file. So essentially, popcorn lets you \u0026ldquo;cue up\u0026rdquo; content ad display it only during fixed periods, while a media element is playing. If you then pause or manually rewind/fast-forward the media element (audio or video), the events will also reset to the appropriate time.\nHTML5 \u0026amp; new possibilities Popcorn works because of new (actually, not so new!) functionality that is provided by the HTML5 standard, and in particular the and  tags. This standard lets you manipulate audio and video directly with HTML and Javascript – something that wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible until about five years ago.\nmulti-media swiss-army knife Popcorn is a sort of Swiss army knife for doing multi-media work in HTML5. There\u0026rsquo;s a main framework – the popcorn library – that provides a simple Javascript interface for talking directly to the media elements. Doing that directly can be hard, so the Popcorn \u0026ldquo;layer\u0026rdquo; makes this work quite a bit easier. This underlying library is used by the Popcorn plugins, which are the elements you will actually be working with. These plugins are fairly simple Javascript programs (the mapping ones are actually kinda complex, and some of the things one wants to do with maps – especially smoothly animate a pan from one location to another – aren\u0026rsquo;t available yet, which is too bad and a bit of a disappointment). It\u0026rsquo;s the plugins that you will actually be working with.\nUsing Popcorn To use popcorn in a web page, you need to define a variable – usually named \u0026lsquo;pop\u0026rsquo; – that creates a popcorn \u0026lsquo;instance\u0026rsquo; on your web page. Then you wrap the variable definition in a simple function that makes sure it gets run when the web page loads.\nPopcorn Plugins Inside the variable definition, you \u0026ldquo;call\u0026rdquo; the plugin function for each event you want to create. The process is very similar to creating timeline events in your timeline – there\u0026rsquo;s a simple syntax that defines a couple of \u0026ldquo;parameters\u0026rdquo; – variables that get \u0026ldquo;passed\u0026rdquo; to the plugin function. The example file defines a bunch of popcorn events; essentially you\u0026rsquo;ll just change the values of these parameters to create your own events. So for instance, here\u0026rsquo;s an example plugin definition:\nlet pop=Popcorn(\u0026#39;#media\u0026#39;) // the leading \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; says \u0026#34;call the `footnote` method of the new `pop` object\u0026#34; .footnote({\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;intro\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;start\u0026#34;:6,\u0026#34;end\u0026#34;:16,\u0026#34;target\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;popcorn-container\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Edna begins by talking about her father, Daniel Kelly (1861-1953). The US census of 1880 for Elgin, IL, gives Daniel’s occupation as blacksmith. In the 1900 census of Port Angeles his occupation is bridge builder; in the 1920 census of Eden Valley it is general farming; in the 1920 census of Eden Valley it is dairy farming. In the 1930 census of Port Angeles he is retired.\u0026#34;}) This is one of the plugins you can use if you like – the footnote plugin. It has just five parameters:\n id – this is for your benefit so you can keep track of what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Use it, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it too much start – when to start playing the element. This is in SECONDS – so forinstance if you want to it to start playing at 6:34, the value would be 394. Keep a calculator on hand. Note that the value is not in quotation marks – that\u0026rsquo;s significant. end – the end time target – where to pop up the event. Don\u0026rsquo;t change this, or your events will show up in the wrong place. With popcorn you can put the new events anywhere on the page, and change any existing element. It\u0026rsquo;s really powerful; we\u0026rsquo;re just brushing the tip of the iceberg. text – this is the text you\u0026rsquo;re going to make appear. This is where your own contribution really comes in.  Available plugins I\u0026rsquo;ve provided examples for as many plugins as I could. All should work as-is:\n Footnote you\u0026rsquo;ve just seen Figure lets you display an image. This adds a new parameter – \u0026lsquo;src\u0026rsquo; – which let you select an image and also link that image to another location, if you so wish. (I haven\u0026rsquo;t tested the linking os it may not be implemented yet). Google Maps Creates a google map. There are a bunch of new parameters here, see our source code for more info. Leaflet Maps offers a slightly more familiar interface, though the problem with slow tile loading still persists. Markdown allows you to add markdown annotations Wikipedia will add the first few paragraphs from a Wikipedia page. Webpage will embed a webpage in an iframe  (The links in this section take you to the plugin sourcecode, which will usually be a directory with 4 files. The html file contains a working example of the plugin code. The js file is the sourcecode itself, and usually starts off with a useful explanation of how the plugin works. The last two files are provided for testing purposes, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to have use them.)\nYou can explore the rest of the plugins as you wish; you may need to add some extra columns to your spreadsheet to get them to work. In particular, Timeline adds some interesting options, and I like wordirver, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t currently behaving properly and needs to be rewritten (don\u0026rsquo;t have time right now!)\nMedia Elements Popcorn works by keying commands to a media element – that is, an HTML tag \u0026lt;audio\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;video\u0026gt;. Here\u0026rsquo;s our sample audio tag:\n\u0026lt;!-- this is our audio div. It\u0026#39;s really important --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;audio id=\u0026#34;media\u0026#34; controls=\u0026#34;controls\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;source src=\u0026#34;media/audio/editededna.mp3\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;audio/mp3\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/audio\u0026gt; I just want you to note three things about this code:\n See how the tag has two attributes. The id is essential, because when we defined \u0026ldquo;pop\u0026rdquo; we told it to look for the element called \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;controls\u0026rdquo; is also important – it ensures that you can pause, rewind, etc. in the browser\u0026rsquo;s buiilt-in media player. The actual file that will be used by the \u0026ldquo;audio\u0026rdquo; element is not defined in the tag itself, but within it – in the tags.  Popcorn Players Our default example plays a local media file from a statically-defined media element. I really hope you will choose to follow this method, though a web-based media element works just as well. However, if you need to, you can use Vimeo and Youtube videos, as well as Soundcloud audio. To do that, you will need to rewrite the project HTML a bit. So, instead of this,\n\u0026lt;!-- this is our audio element. It holds the audio file. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;audio id=\u0026#34;media\u0026#34; controls=\u0026#34;controls\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Make sure this points to the actual mp3 file you are analyzing --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;source src=\u0026#34;https://storycorpsorg-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/walsh2-1.mp3\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;audio/mp3\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/audio\u0026gt; You will want something like this:\n\u0026lt;section id=#media\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; Then, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to modify line 6 of popcorn-data-from-google.js:\npop = Popcorn(\u0026#34;#media\u0026#34;) and use something like one of the models below:\nconst pop = Popcorn.smart( \u0026#34;#media\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oar9glUCL0\u0026#34; ); // const pop = Popcorn.smart( \u0026#34;#media\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;https://vimeo.com/267718090\u0026#39; ); // const = Popcorn.smart( \u0026#34;#media\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;https://soundcloud.com/corbanbrook/leaving-on-a-spaceship\u0026#39; ); the soundcloud player is a little buggy – it emits a loud crackle when you start playback, and the \u0026lsquo;play\u0026rsquo; button needs to be pushed twice. Also, there are no built-in volume controls (!). In fact, we have to add a little bit of hacky code to get the player to work at all. So you\u0026rsquo;ll need something like this, on say line 22 (ish):\npop.media.controls = true; pop.unmute(); pop.media.volume = 65; set the volume to whatever level feels right as the user won\u0026rsquo;t be able to change it.\nGetting Help If you end up confused, there are a couple of useful popcorn resources on the web.\n alas, most of the old resources have been taken down in the past 2 years. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is the Github repo and the docs website, and both have been derelict for about 6 months. You can see my changes in my main pull request, and browse through the issues I\u0026rsquo;ve been submitting, especially number 80.  CSS and Popcorn display issues In its day, Popcorn was designed for cutting-edge features that were just making their way to ghe browser. Now, no so much: the framework fails to take advantage of many of the new features of CSS3, and plugins are full of ugly, hard-coded CSS that can be hard to deal with. I have started to fix this issue, and in the plugins you are likely to use, much of the ugliest CSS has been stripped out. Instead, most plugins now neatly generate their own boxes (usually a `div` element) with an id and a class that you can set in CSS.\nFor the assignment, I have set the popcorn container element to display: flex, which is a pretty good default choice. Most events will attempt to set a width of 30em, or about the width of 30 characters, and then grow or shrink if they have to. This default works well for most kinds of information, but not for all, so I\u0026rsquo;ve provided some examples of how to modify the default size. You can set the element id for most plugins with the id column of the spreadsheet, and most plugins now add a class like PLLUGINNAME-plugin to their enclosing element.\nGenerating Events with Tabletop In class, we hand-coded our popcorn events. This is not particularly onerous but is a little clumsy. You are absolutely welcome to use this method for the assignment if you like; but there is another way. the tabletop.js library lets you access information from a Google Spreadsheet and plug it into your scripts. I find it very handy for this kind of work (we could have used it for the mapping expercise, too). In this way, you can create your popcorn events in the leisure of a Google Spreadsheet, and have the events automatically generated for you whenbever your web page loads.\nThe process is described in the tabletop repository, and you are strongly advised to read it carefully. If you want to use the code I\u0026rsquo;ve provided for you in popcorn-data-with-google.js, you will need to copy this spreadsheet, then publish it as described in the tabletop instructions (see above), and also copy the new URL into the appropriate place in popcorn-data-with-google.js. Then code your popcorn in the spreadsheet; unless you make any syntax errors, the technical work should now be done. In the spreadsheet it is somewhat easier, for instance, to arange your events in sequence, etc.\n"

Both MDN and EJ have built-in JS Consoles forexperimenting with code (see below).\nMDN also has a more advanced guide to JavaScript which starts with this \u0026ldquo;reintroduction\u0026rdquo;. This can be worth consulting if you want more information.\nConsoles and Playgrounds Sometimes you will want to try out your code and test out your ideas before putting them in a permanent file. There are various tools for this.\n Browser consoles and scratchpads Your browser has a built-in \u0026ldquo;console\u0026rdquo; where you can enter javascript commands and see their output.

Exit by typing Control-d or Control-c Control-c or .exit. VSCode Debugger VSCode has an excellent debugger. However, debugging is a complicated subject. If you want to try to use these tools, read the docs. VSCode extensions There are many excellent VSCode extensions for JavaScript. You can experiment with quokka, for instance.

But what kind of a B?\n   If your class participation was: You get a: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor B- 72   Satisfactory B 75   Excellent B+ 78    Similarly, perhaps you were only able to complete the Git \u0026amp; Github, HTML \u0026amp; CSS, Javascript and Oral History. Oops! You\u0026rsquo;re going to get a C. Like your somewhat happier classmate, your final grade will be assigned thus:\n   If your class participation was: You get a: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor C- 62   Satisfactory C 65   Excellent C+ 68    But Note!\nA+ is a special grade. Suppose you complete all the assignments satisfactorily, including the additional \u0026ldquo;A only\u0026rdquo; sections of the relevant assignments. Wow! You get an A, great. But… do you get an A+?\n   If your class participation was: You get an: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor A- 83   Satisfactory A 88   Excellent DEPENDS DEPENDS    Even if your participation was excellent, you will only receive an A+ if your work was consistently excellent and occasionally brilliant. So, if you successfully complete all the assignments (great!), and also are a great class participant (thanks!), then I\u0026rsquo;ll look over all your work and make a value judgment about whether you deserve this rare and precious grade.\nFinal Note for 2018 – this year, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; grade. To pass the course you basically have to get a C. In rare cases I will consider lowering the grading criteria for the \u0026ldquo;Oral History\u0026rdquo; assignment to permit a student to scrape through the course.\nParticipation Criteria Your participation mark is a combination of in-class and online participation.\nIn the Classroom But what makes for good class participation? You might want to start by reading How to discuss a book for history, which has lots of helpful suggestions. Really, please read it – it\u0026rsquo;s illuminating. But, meanwhile, here are some hints:\n Show up for class It\u0026rsquo;s hard to discuss when you\u0026rsquo;re not here. Do the Readings It\u0026rsquo;s hard to discuss what you haven\u0026rsquo;t read. I will try hard not to assign too much reading; in return, please try to read it. Be Courteous Treat your classmates with respect, even when your opinions differ fiercely. Refrain from interrupting others, notice when others have been waiting \u0026amp; let them speak first, and so on. Don\u0026rsquo;t shut other people down, and frame your comments in a way that invites further discussion. Listen Pay careful attention when your classmates are speaking; if their ideas seem a little unclear, try to fill in the gaps, either by thinking silently, or by asking friendly, clarifying questions. Try to think about how their positions relate to yours, and, especially, whether you should perhaps change your mind a little based on what they have to say. Be Clear think about the readings before you come to class, so that your opinions are well-formed. Be Brave It can be intimidating to speak in class, especially if you have found the readings or the lecture confusing. But you will almost never be alone. If one person is confused, others likely are too. Have the courage to speak up – everyone in the room is likely to thank you. If you are extremely shy in person, then come speak to me and we can try to work out a solution for you. Participate in Group work Occasionally we will break up into small groups. The same princples apply to group work – I\u0026rsquo;ll be paying attention.  Online Our Slack workspace is also a great way to participate. Contribute to the class in Slack by asking good questions, helping out your classmates, and correcting any professorial errors from lecture!\nFinally If you can do all of these things consistently, you\u0026rsquo;re likely to earn a \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo;. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how you\u0026rsquo;re doing, come ask me in a couple of weeks and I\u0026rsquo;ll give you some feedback.\n"

	"content": "The Programming Historian link below is excellent. Having some trouble with screenshots ATM, will fix soon as I can reload my desktop – but for next few hours pls refer to the PH link for images!\nOne common issue for people new to the command line is that it can be tough to understand the notion of location in the filesystem. Most ordinary users interact with their filesystems through the so-called GUI layer – the graphical interface of windows. Often the user-accessible files are more or less restyricted to special directories (or \u0026ldquo;folders\u0026rdquo;) with meaningful names like Desktop, MyDocuments, etc. However, once you start working at the command line this convenient feature can become something of a curse. It\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize that these special locations are just part of a complex, hierarchical filesystem – a branching tree of directories and files, on which your operating system relies in many ways. You will need to learn to navigate that filesystem, not from the GUI, but from the command line.\nWhen you first start using the command line, it often feels (a) confusing and (b) somehow primitive or over-simple. The command line is, in fact, a sophisticated and incredibly efficient way to interact with the filesystem – but you need to learn your way around it first. In this class we won\u0026rsquo;t discuss the wonderful world of shell scripting (see below for guides to scripting); instead, I just want you to learn a few very basic commands to help you move around.\nNavigation The file system is a \u0026ldquo;branching tree\u0026rdquo; of files and folders. At the top (or bottom, depending on how you imagine things) of the tree is the \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo;. In bash, we represent this as /. Every folder has a path that starts with / and proceeds down the file hierarchy. So, for instance, my global git configuration is located at /home/matt/.gitconfig. / is the root. /home/ is where all user files can be found. /home/matt/ contains all my user files. /home/matt/.gitconfig identifies the specific file I\u0026rsquo;m looking for.\nYour file explorer will represent this tree for you visually; you can also picture it schematically, as is done e.g. in the following image: We can also explore from the command line. Here are a few basic commands to learn for this purpose. [ Note: in the screenshots below, my command prompt is heavily customized and includes some extra information. Most notably, it tells me when I am in a git repository and gives me the name of the current git branch. You can experiment with changing your bash prompt in the ~/.bashrc file that controls many features of the\npwd pwd is short for \u0026ldquo;print working directory\u0026rdquo;, and will show you where you are in the file system. ls ls will list the contents of a directory. With no further arguments it will list the directory you\u0026rsquo;re currently in, but you can ask it to list some other directory too. Here are some examples. Note the \u0026ldquo;switches\u0026rdquo; -l and -la. Switches give further instructions to the command. In this case -l means \u0026ldquo;long\u0026rdquo; while -a is short for \u0026ldquo;all\u0026rdquo;. You can see in the screenshot below what the effect is. cd Short for \u0026ldquo;change directory\u0026rdquo;, cd allows you to move through the filesystem.\n cd someDirectoryName will move you into the subdirectory \u0026ldquo;someDirectoryName\u0026rdquo; of your current directory. cd with no arguments, or \u0026ldquo;cd ~ \u0026ldquo;, will drop you back into your home directory (this is helpful if you get lost somehow). At the command line, the tilde (~) is short for \u0026ldquo;home directory\u0026rdquo;, so you can use it anywhere instead of typing out your whole whome directory name. cd .. or cd ../ will move you \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; one level in the filesystem – so if you are currently in /home/matt/digitalHistory, executing cd .. will move you to /home/matt/.    cat and less Sometimes you want to look at the contents of a file. cat and less are two ways to do so. cat will print the contents of the file directly to your terminal window. less will create a simple interface that you can use to scroll through a longer file using a keyboard interface. mkdir and touch mkdir will create a new directory, while touch will create a new (empty) file.\nmkdir some-directory-name touch some-directory-name/somefile.txt These commands will create the file somefile.txt in the folder some-directory-name, inside the current working directory.\nArrow Keys and Tab Expansion often we make mistakes typing or are unsure of spelling, etc. Two kinds of shortcuts make for huge time savings:\n arrow keys can be used to navigate through your previous commands – typing ↑ will reproduce your previous command, allowing you to correct any errors you might have made the last time you typed out some complex command and made a small error. Each time you type an ↑, you will move one command up in the command history. To get back down, type ↓. you can type TAB part way through a command to get a list of possible completions. If there\u0026rsquo;s only one possible command that starts with what you\u0026rsquo;ve typed so far, bash will complete it for you. Similarly, typing part of a file or directory name after a command has been entered will usually get you a list of possible completions. Try it a few times and you\u0026rsquo;ll see how much time it saves.  Learn More OK, that\u0026rsquo;s all for now, hopefully this helps you navigate around your projects. I may add to this guide as we go through the semester, but here are some further guides.\n this introduction is quite clear and simple the programming historian has a great guide too the TLDP guide introduced generations of programmers to bash scripting, and is still a useful reference point  "

	"content": "Node.js is an exquisite piece of programming infrastructure. One of its main features is support for developer-defined dependencies. As a programmer – or in my case, as a teacher – you can inform the underlying node package manager (npm) that your project \u0026ldquo;depends\u0026rdquo; on some group of other projects. This allows programmers to build constantly on each other\u0026rsquo;s work.\nIn our assignments, node dependencies are mostly used to enable the tests, whose main function is to help you figure out whether you\u0026rsquo;ve done the assignments correctly. Installing node dependencies is pretty simple, but can be confusing if you\u0026rsquo;re completely new to node, the command line, and programming in general. Here are the (very simple!) instructions:\n Install Node and NPM as per this section of the \u0026ldquo;Setup\u0026rdquo; instructions From the command line, navigate to the root directory of your repository using cd as per the navigation help page From the root directory of your repository,type the following command into the terminal/git-bash prompt: npm install  You should see some complex output from the command, after which your node dependencies will be installed. You can actually see the installed files by browsing the contents of the node_modules directory, which should now be present in your working directory.\nOnce the dependencies are installed, you should be able to run the node tests with npm test (issued from the same directory, that is, the root directory of your repository). If you\u0026rsquo;ve installed the VSCode extentions, ou\nI hope that helps!\n"

Why care about the Digital Age?  History  The World Out of Which We Come   The past is the world out of which we have come, the multitude of events and experiences that have shaped our conscious selves and the social worlds we inhabit. To understand how and why we live as we do, we cannot avoid appealing to the past to explain how and why we got to be this way. ([CrononWhyMatters2000], p. 4)    Not just Fact but Story   It is remembering and storytelling we care about, not the raw past, because only by being perennially resurrected in the mind of each new generation does the past become meaningful. Only this does it become a living memory which in turn gives meaning to our present lives by reminding us ho we are\u0026#x2013;as individuals, as a state and nation, as a people.

The Public Sphere  Jürgen Habermas (b. 1929): Authenticity in a media age  pre-eminent German public intellectual of 1960's and 1970's role of Holocaust/Fascism in all his thinking inheritance from the Frankfurt School search for \"authentic\" forms of communication    Figure 1: Jürgen Habermas    Mid-century anxiety Appearance of new media (radio, TV, new kinds of magazine) Are these \"degraded\"? Do the media make us stupider? Less critical? More pliable?   Reasons to worry       maybe there are material conditions that make this sort of evil possible? perhaps the media of communication have a role?    Concept of the Public Sphere   By \"the public sphere\" we mean\u0026#x2026; a realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed\u0026#x2026; Citizens behave as a public body when they confer in an unrestricted fashion \u0026#x2013; that is, with the guarantee of freedom of assembly and association and the freedom to express and publish their opinions \u0026#x2013; about matters of general interest. (Habermas 1964, p.49[p.2])    A portion of the public sphere comes into being in every conversation in which private individuals assemble to form a public body.  \u0026#x2013; J. Habermas   #+BEGIN_NOTES  Habermas wants us to believe in the reality of the \"public sphere\", as a discursive body composed of conversations that have a certain form Unpacking:  \"something approaching public opinion\": suggests that \"public opinion\" has a technical meaning Conferring in an unrestricted fashion: the public sphere requires a certain kind of freedom Matters of general interest: we're not talking about breakfast, jeans, or lipstick.    Public and Private     Public Private     open to all restricted   accessible for money closed even if you can pay   state-related non-state, civil society   political non-political   official non-official   common special   impersonal personal   national or popular group, class, or locale   international/universal particular/finite   in view of others concealed   outside the home domestic   circulated in print/electronic media circulated orally/in manuscript   known widely known only to a few   acknowledged/explicit tacit/implicit     many definitions not all of them part of Habermas's terminology    Concept of the Public Sphere  Strukturwandlung der Öffentlichkeit (1962)  Arena ruled by rational argument Freedom of expression prevails (\u0026#x2026;an unrestricted fashion) Conversations concern common interests (e.g. ?) both ideal and historical arises first in 18th Century flourishes and then withers in 19th at a nadir in 20th; can it be revived?   Habermas's Habilitation and first important book. but 35 years old!!   Before Bourgeois Society  There is no \"Public Sphere\" Instead there are \"Public Individuals\" with certain powers  and Church authorities, empowered to speak on moral matters  Opposed to these are \"private persons\"   Begin the historical story w/ the classic trnasition to a bourgeois/capitalist society around 1800.  before this point, not public sphere, just public individuals, who are distinct from 'private persons\"    Private and Public Persons   A private person has no right to pass public and perhaps even disapproving judgement on the actions, procedures, laws, regulations, and ordinances of sovereigns and courts\u0026#x2026;. or to publish in print pertinent reports that he manages to obtain. For a private person is not at all capable of making such judgment, because he lacks complete knowledge of circumstances and motives.  \u0026#x2013; Frederick 'the Great' of Prussia, 1784   \"Private\" and \"Public\" distinguish types of person, not types of activity.   18th Century Origins  How do we get from a monarchy in which only 'public persons' have license to speak on 'public matters', to a 'public sphere' which is opened more widely?  Rise of newspapers/journals. Intrusion of private commentary on 'public' matters  a new kind of media  rise of salons \u0026amp; coffee houses.  a new kind of sociality.    Salons and Coffee Houses  Salons as the heart of intellectual activity in c. 18  'monopoly on first publication' mixing of classes freedom from patronage  Coffee Houses a similar space  But no restrictions on topics of discourse matters of politics as frequent a topic as art  an ideal of common humanity esp. in coffee houses  opinions judged by reason alone  no intrusion of 'distinction' or finance  [ but note: imperfection of this vision ]           one of the longstanding critiques of Habermas is the actual restrictiveness of coffee houses in real life. Who's excluded? make a list: women, the truly poor, non-Europeans, the uneducated (to some extent),   Circulation  Communication across broad spaces \u0026amp; differences needs something more than conversation need a way get ideas to large numbers  news sheets \u0026rarr; newspapers letters \u0026rarr; journals    Markets  Through newspapers \u0026amp; journals conversation becomes a commodity Therefore it loses its exclusivity so, in the beginning, commodification is a good thing   This process of commodification, and its trasformation from a positive, welcome force in to a troubling, destructive one is central to H but is not just his idea.   The State vs. Society  This is all happening in a pre-democratic era (mostly) 'The People' are a problem for the state growth of 'the social' a threat to sovereignty 'public sphere' precarious and subject to dissolution   The Structure of the Public Sphere      Private Realm Public Sphere Sphere of Public Authority     Civil Society (Commodity Exchange, social labour) Political Public Sphere State   Conjugal Family Literary/Philosophical Public Sphere Court     the public sphere sits between Private Life and Authority, striving for independence from both it mediates between them and draws its legitimacy from its use of reason note that it presupposes an emergent realm of \"privacy\" \u0026#x2013; and so, it is grounded in that notion, like all liberal philosophical constructs   From Debate to Consumption  Public Sphere in effect undoes itself success of media dissolves the reciprocal creation \u0026amp; communication of ideas  instead we just consume reason begins to vanish  Massive growth of media in c.20  radio, television, film  The Public Sphere: A Hollow Shell?  Where is its legitimacy?      Habermas' Reception  extremely influential with some questions about both the historical and the philosophical elements of the story.   Counterpublics   \u0026#x2026;some publics are defined by their tension with a larger public\u0026#x2026; Discussion with such a public is understood to contravene the rules obtaining in the world at large\u0026#x2026; This kind of public is, in effect, a counterpublic: it maintains at some level\u0026#x2026; an awareness of its subordinate status. \u0026#x2013; M. Warner (2002)   One or Many?  Habermas sees Public Sphere as necessarily unitary But discourse carves out separate spaces  that may correlate with social divides \u0026#x2026; and where the addressee (\"stranger\") is presumed to share a common subordination with the speaker  (\"Given the fact that almost anyone can contribute to public discourse, the multiplicity of perspectives makes it even more difficult to define public opinion. Any designation of public opinion then becomes arbitrary\")   Disinterested or embodied?  for Habermas separation of individual from both \"accidental\" circumstances and official capacities is paramount Warner: This is fictive  and anyway undesirable  because some kinds of \"argument\" are fundamentally corporeal this doesn't make them less legitimate does it?     Reading or Acting  Habermas: the actions of a legitimate public sphere are actions of reading (scrutinize, judge, decide) Warner: in a counterpublic, there may be other sorts of actions (prance, diss, act up, fantasize, mourn)     How this matters for History  If there are many \"publics\", then working to carve out a particular space for discourse can have salutary effects Modes of address and standards of comportment can differ across 'publics' May even be possible to craft a 'public' around our work.  though \" it follows that the public exists only as long as the text is being engaged with\"      Enter the Internet  Habermas' theory revolves around a technology and a social institution  enabled by print, threatened by TV can the Internet undo this dissolution? If so, how? if not, is it the apotheosis of that dissolution?    Digital History and the Public Sphere  Does the Internet provide a space for authentic public conversatoin? What are effects of the medium on how we pursue knowledge and truth?  state and corporate pressures algorithmic actors (!)   Technical Affordances of the web  instantaneous distribution distributed production machine-readable text algorithmic sorting   All of these are present in every web-based communication. But realms of the web have distinct affordances of their own: Reddit \u0026ne; twitter \u0026ne; facebook \u0026ne; The New York Times   Our Take-away  can we use this historical framework to make sense the present? how can we engage with these technical affordances to make a \"public sphere\" that we want to see in the world?         // Full list of configuration options available here: // https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#configuration Reveal.initialize({ controls: true, progress: true, history: true, center: false, slideNumber: 'c', rollingLinks: false, keyboard: true, mouseWheel: false, fragmentInURL: false, hashOneBasedIndex: false, pdfSeparateFragments: true, overview: true, width: \"100%\", height: \"100%\", margin: 0.10, minScale: 1.00, maxScale: 1.00, theme: Reveal.getQueryHash().theme, // available themes are in /css/theme transition: Reveal.getQueryHash().transition || 'convex', // see README of reveal.js for options transitionSpeed: 'default', // Optional libraries used to extend reveal.js dependencies: [ {src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/klipse_reveal.js'}, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }, { src: '../../vendor/reveal//plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }] });    "

Class selectors: these give the name of a class attribute that an HTML element may have. This selector will always begin with a period (\".\"). So for instance: ID selector: this addresses the element with a particular ID:    Selector types \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; div#cssdemo h1 { font-size: 3em; color: red; } div#cssdemo p { font-size:5em} .coolpara { color:green; } div#cssdemo #myfave { color:yellow; background-color: black; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\"cssdemo\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p class=\"coolpara\"\u0026gt;Some Content\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p id=\"myfave\"\u0026gt;Some Content\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;     div#cssdemo h1 { font-size: 3em; color: red; } div#cssdemo p { font-size:5em} .coolpara { color:green; } div#cssdemo #myfave { color:yellow; background-color: black; }   Heading Some Content\nSome Content\n  More Selectors \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; div#main p { color:red; } div#main \u0026gt; p.blue { color: blue; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\"main\"\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; regular (red) paragraph\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p class=\"blue\"\u0026gt; not a regular paragraph (blue) \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;      function shadowizemore_selectors () {var elId=\"more_selectors\"; var dom_block=\"\\n div#main p {\\n color:red;\\n }\\n\\n div#main  p.blue {\\n color: blue;\\n }\\n \\n \\n  regular (red) paragraph\n\\n not a regular paragraph (blue) \\n \"; function createElementFromHTML(htmlString) { let div = document.createElement('div'); div.innerHTML = htmlString.trim(); // Change This to div.childNodes to support multiple top-level nodes return div; } window.addEventListener(\"load\",function(){ //var htmlString = dom_block; if (typeof document != 'undefined') { console.log(\"Attaching shadow to \",elId); let sroot = document.getElementById(elId).attachShadow({mode: 'open'}); sroot.appendChild(createElementFromHTML(dom_block)); } //return (htmlString); // console.log(\"HTMLSTRING!\" + htmlString); });} shadowizemore_selectors()   Finally, we have many more complex selectors. This one here is a descendant selector   It addresses every p that is contained inside a div of id \"main.\"     Selectors and the Cascade  Priority: inline \u0026rarr; id \u0026rarr; class \u0026rarr; element/tag fine gradations within this the awful !important rule     Color Values  Various representations:  ul#color-rules {font-size 1.5rem;} ul#color-rules li span.red {color: #FF0000} ul#color-rules li span.green {color: #00FF00} ul#color-rules li span.blue {color: #0000FF}   color: # 00 7F FF ;   color: rgb( 00, 127, 255 );   color: rgba( 00, 127, 255, 0.6);    (also hsl, hsla)  Fonts, colors and borders div.main { color: rgb(150,150,150); background-color: (#b0c4ee); text-align: center; text-decoration:underline; font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, Serif; font-style:italic; font-size:1.25em; border: 4px green solid; border-radius:20%; }     div#maincss2 { color: rgb(150,150,150); background-color: (#b0c4ee); text-align: center; text-decoration:underline; font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, Serif; font-style:italic; font-size:1.25em; border: 4px green solid; border-radius:20%; }   here is a sample paragraph doing all of this stuff...\n  A lot of what we do with CSS is to set fonts and colors. Here are some examples: There are plenty of other properties that can be set, in much the same way.

A lot of the grief you will encounter when designing websites will come back to the box model, so it's important to learn it:     \"Russian Dolls\"      Display: Block vs. Inline    block elements have their own boxes inline elements do not have boxes. height, width, padding, work inconsistently. inline-block elements don't make \"true\" boxes but allow you to set height and width.   by default, these elements are inline:  a, b, i, strong, em, span, img   while these are block:  div, article, section, nav, hx, p, ul, ol, li, main, header, footer      Normal Flow  page processed sequentially each block-level element gets its own line inline elements displayed inside those lines heights of lines set by height of content     Layout: Overriding \"normal\" flows  instruct elements to either step out of the normal flow or set new rues for their \"internal\" or \"external\" flow     Layout Methods  display property position property float property   We focus on display but dip into the other methods    Display  values we care about:  display: none display: block/inline/inline-block display: flex display: grid     Default View \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; main { display: block; } header { display:block; color: magenta; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;main\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;header\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;article\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;article p\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt;footer\u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/main\u0026gt;      function shadowizebasic_layout () {var elId=\"basic_layout\"; var dom_block=\"\\n main {\\n display: block;\\n }\\n\\n header {\\n display:block;\\n color: magenta;\\n }\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n header\\n \\n \\n article p\n\\n \\n footer\\n\\n\"; function createElementFromHTML(htmlString) { let div = document.createElement('div'); div.innerHTML = htmlString.trim(); // Change This to div.childNodes to support multiple top-level nodes return div; } window.addEventListener(\"load\",function(){ //var htmlString = dom_block; if (typeof document != 'undefined') { console.log(\"Attaching shadow to \",elId); let sroot = document.getElementById(elId).attachShadow({mode: 'open'}); sroot.appendChild(createElementFromHTML(dom_block)); } //return (htmlString); // console.log(\"HTMLSTRING!\" + htmlString); });} shadowizebasic_layout()     Display: None  hide element completely so that it takes up no space at all \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; main { display: block; } header { display: none; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;main\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;header\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;article\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;article p\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt;footer\u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/main\u0026gt;      function shadowizedisplay_none () {var elId=\"display_none\"; var dom_block=\"\\n main {\\n display: block;\\n }\\n\\n header {\\n display: none;\\n }\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n header\\n \\n \\n article p\n\\n \\n footer\\n\\n\"; function createElementFromHTML(htmlString) { let div = document.createElement('div'); div.innerHTML = htmlString.trim(); // Change This to div.childNodes to support multiple top-level nodes return div; } window.addEventListener(\"load\",function(){ //var htmlString = dom_block; if (typeof document != 'undefined') { console.log(\"Attaching shadow to \",elId); let sroot = document.getElementById(elId).attachShadow({mode: 'open'}); sroot.appendChild(createElementFromHTML(dom_block)); } //return (htmlString); // console.log(\"HTMLSTRING!\" + htmlString); });} shadowizedisplay_none()     Display: Flex \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; main { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: stretch; } main\u0026gt;* { flex-grow: 1; } header { color: magenta; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;main\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;header\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;article\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;article p\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt;footer\u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/main\u0026gt;    one-dimensional layout \"content-out\"  container determines direction \u0026amp; a few defaults most styling still in children  revolutionary!
