	"content": "  Table of Contents  Assignment Getting your assignment, and handing it in Learning Objectives Expectations    Due Date: March 03\nIn class, we made a kind of toy Google Map out of hand-coded HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You will remember it from the course website, from JSBin, and from Github.\nYour next assignment builds directly from that in-class exercise, and should be quite a bit easier to manage, technically, than your last assignment. Essentially, you will repeat the in-class assignment with much greater intellectual effort, but using the same technical framework. Please work directly with the files in the Github repo, either by forking the repo, or downloading the zipball.\nAssignment Build a web page that includes a Google Map (complete with markers) as part of a short but substantive historical exploration of a historical topic of interest to you. We discussed a number of such themes in the class (you should remember them from our discussion). The final product should meet the following criteria:\n Essay: You should write a short essay, approximately 900 words (~ 3-4 pages double-spaced, if we were using word processors) addressing a small, specific historical topic with a spatial history component. That is, the \u0026ldquo;spatial\u0026rdquo; element shouldn\u0026rsquo;t just be an afterthought, but should be at the centre of your analysis.\nHere are some plausible examples of appropriate topics:\n Corridor of Power: Berlin\u0026rsquo;s Friedrichstrasse in the Nazi Era End of an Era: Toronto\u0026rsquo;s last meatpacking plants An Empire at Home: conservative Think Tanks in Washington, D.C.  I just made these up, of course. You should pick something that you (a) know something about already, and (b) are interested in. Ideally, you will already have done some research into this topic, and will have a small number of sources ready to hand. The essay should introduce the reader to the topic, and make a not-too-complex argument which, again, highlights the spatial component. (\u0026ldquo;Think tanks, so important in the construction of policy in today\u0026rsquo;s United States, are a relatively new feature of American politics. In this paper, I will discuss the early history of this now-paramount institutional form, and argue that the geographical proximity of these think tanks is actually an important feature.\u0026ldquo;)\nYou may notice that most of my examples are drawn from a kind of urban history. Urban history is obviously well-suited to spatial analysis, but there\u0026rsquo;s no reason you can\u0026rsquo;t describe, for instance, more widespread networks (e.g., to take some examples at random, networks of hippies, underground bus networks, comparative suffrage movements. etc.)\nTake this opportunity to think about the effect of form on content. How does the present of the map change the way you express your thoughts? Are new kinds of arguments possible? On the flip side, does the map lead you to ignore or downplay any important elements?\nThe essay will be written in Markdown, which makes traditional citations a little complicated (Scholarly Markdown solves that problem, but it\u0026rsquo;s fairly difficult to set up). So please use simple links for your citations; in Markdown, these take the form [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com). So, for instance: [Latour, p. 97](http://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?5484640\u0026amp;uuid=4f41639c-43d4-45e8-81f2-d8acd9263f8a). Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about a bibliography.\n Map: Your map should have at least 5 markers, and could have many more. You can explore more complex objects \u0026ndash; such as polygons \u0026ndash; using the geoJSON import feature sof Google Maps. There are links to the API documentation in the code.\nIn class, we cut and paste to create multiple markers. The assignment template uses a for loop to iterate, that is, repeat, a set of actions for a group of markers. See the template for details. Each marker\u0026rsquo;s info-window contents should contain a brief headline and some explanatory text. Your essay should refer back to the markers, and you are free to refer to your essay in the marker text itself.\n Styling: As was also the case with our in-class assignment, the bulk of the styling work is accomplished for us by the strapdown.js script that we call at the bottom of the page. Remember that you can use any of several bootswatch themes if you would like to try a different overall look. If you like, you can also customize the CSS further by using the style.css file in the project folder\n  Getting your assignment, and handing it in This assignment is stored on Github. You can get it easily by navigating to https://github.com/titaniumbones/maps-with-markdown and locating the \u0026ldquo;DownloadZIP\u0026rdquo; button.\nTo hand it in, simply rezip the folder and send it to me at the Dropbox Request URL I\u0026rsquo;ll send you before the due date; be sure to rename the folder itself to something that contains your name before zipping, e.g., \u0026ldquo;matt-price-his389-spatial-history\u0026rdquo;. If you don\u0026rsquo;t take this step, your work will not be preserved and I won\u0026rsquo;t grade your assignment.\nOr: If you like, you are more than welcome to login to your github account, fork the repository, edit, and push your changes to the web; if you do that, then all you need to do is send me the URL of your new repository.\nLearning Objectives  Understand what a Google Map is and how it relates to GIS Learn the simplest parts of the Google Maps Javascript API, and use them to create map elements Integrate a written historical narrative with a digital map object  Expectations Your essay should meet the ordinary criteria for an historical essay: clearly written, providing adequate evidence, minimal spelling and grammatical errors, etc. The relationship between topic and map should not be artificial \u0026ndash; the map should serve as an important part of your historical argument or explanation.\nYour Map should work \u0026ndash; all your markers should display correctly. The initial zoom should be set so that all of your markers are visible, and when I click on those markers the appropriate text should display. Markers should provide information that makes your written text clearer or more persuasive.\nWhile there is not much styling work to do, you should not create a terrible mess! You should make small visual changes to the default layout to make the legend more useful and visually appealling, and think about further work if it seems appropriate.\nA \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; paper will make a convincing, interesting argument, using the map as an important and cogent support. An \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; paper will do the same, but will do all of the above just a little bit better. \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; papers wil lbe deficient in some of these areas.\n"

	"content": "  Table of Contents  Call for Proposals: Digital History Initiative Grants Structure Expectations    Due Date: April 05\nFor your final assignment, respond to the following call for proposals with an application approximately 2000 words in length, plus a provisional budget i n the form of a spreadsheet. See below for details.\nCall for Proposals: Digital History Initiative Grants The Hacking History Foundation is pleased to announce a new Digital History Initiative, intended to advance the field of digital historical studies in Canada. We are grateful to an anonymous donor from Qatar who has agreed to underwrite three levels of grant:\n Student Development Grant: This grant of $15,000, to be spend within a period of 12 months, funds small or preliminary projects developed by undergraduate or graduate students. Small Team Grant: This grant funds up to $50,000 of work by a small team, in a period of 1-3 years. Large Grant: This fund, which has no fixed upper limit of funding, funds long-term projects over a period of 3-5 years.  We invite applications for all three categories, to be submitted by 2017-04-05 Wed. Be sure to identify the category of grant you are applying for. Regardless of the project\u0026rsquo;s scale, the proposal should be:\n of genuine historical interest technically feasible appropriate to the DH methods that might be discussed e.g. in a course such as \u0026ldquo;Digital History\u0026rdquo; at the University of Toronto of real personal or professional interest to you, the applicant.  The Hacking History Foundation strongly values honesty. It is not necessary for you yourself to possess all the skills to complete the project; but you should be able to clearly articulate the nature of the technical challenges and have a realistic assessment of what is required to overcome them. You should also be able to articulate the historical import of the project, and its worthiness for public funding, because even though we are funded by shadowy carbon-spewing billionaires, our Foundation has a strong sense of civic duty.\nStructure The proposal should be composed of the following elements (word lengths are approximate):\n Introduction (500 words): In broad strokes, describe the project, the questions it is intended to answer, and the role of Digital History methods within the project Methods (500 words): Describe the tools you intend to use, and your plans for both research and dissemination of results Timeline (500 words): Describe the work that will be required to complete this project, and how much time you and your potential collaborators or research assistants will require to bring it to completion Importance (500 words): Discuss the importance of this research, and its place in a broader historical conversation Budget (1 Spreadsheet page): Outline and justify the costs of the project. [Note to students of Hacking History: we recognize that your costs may be, er, rough ballpark estimates. You won\u0026rsquo;t be graded on the accuracy of your budget, but make a serious effort to include all the categories of cost.]  Expectations This is a difficult assignment. As usual, you should turn in a lucidly-written paper with minimal grammatical or spelling errors, written in accordance with scholarly standards for citation and originality. Your project should be of genuine historical interest, and your text should convince me of that importance. Your methods section should describe the challenges inherent in the project, and provide a provisional plan for overcoming them. You should demonstrate awareness both of the difficulties of DH research, and of the existing resources that are available to scholars undertaking this kind of work.\nIf you wish, you may certainly build upon other work you have done this semester.\nGood luck! I look forward to the results.\n"

However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this initial assignment, we\u0026rsquo;ll use one of the web\u0026rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work. We\u0026rsquo;ll then extend that knowledge with a set of slightly more advanced programming exercises.\nWeb pages are composed of three components: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page; CSS controls the style of presentation; and Javascript permits dynamic modification of both. To explore the web from the inside, you need to be a little bit comfortable in all three.\nAssignment The assignment details are listed in the Github repository. Read them there and follow them carefully.\n"

In the case of questions having to do with official University business (requests for extensions, discussion of accommodations, any message involving sensitive personal data) please use my University email, being sure to put \u0026ldquo;HIS389\u0026rdquo; in the subject line.\nIntroduction We all know \u0026#x2013; it is so commonplace that we barely even notice it! \u0026#x2013; that we are living through a revolutionary period in the history of communication. In the year of your birth, the World Wide Web was a scrawny, hand-powered frontier of hand-coded sites and Internet startups. Amazon and Google were infants. The University of Toronto Library website looked something like this:\n and many students and faculty still used the card catalog to find books in Robarts.\nToday, the processes of research, writing and reading are all dramatically transformed by information technology. Instead of painstakingly discovering rare books and manuscript artifacts, we can do full-text searches on a vast corpus. Our writing is mediated by immensely powerful computing machines, and our creations need not be limited exclusively to the linear texts around which all the humanities initially took shape. Readers encounter our writing, not as a few precious drops of information in a desert of ignorance, but as part of an endless stream of information that assaults them all day long.\nHow should history respond to these new conditions of our existence? In this class we explore foundational topics in the \u0026ldquo;digital humanities\u0026rdquo; and ask what we can learn from them about how we should be doing history \u0026#x2013; in particular, how we should be collecting, analyzing, synthesizing and presenting knowledge.\n How do the digital media developed in the last two decades change the way we understand history? Can the fundamental goal of interpreting the past survive? What, if any, new technical skills do we need to acquire? Can we use the new media to ask (and answer!) new kinds of questions? Can they help us improve our answers to the old questions? Perhaps most powerfully: how do the new digital conditions of existence relate to the question of \u0026ldquo;engaged\u0026rdquo; scholarship? What new opportunities, constraints, and dangers does digital production call forth when we mix scholarship and citizenship?  Objectives At the end of this course, you should:\n be able to describe to others what the phrase \u0026ldquo;digital humanities\u0026rdquo; means to you. be able to frame a coherent and nuanced argument of your own about the value of DH methods to the field of history be able to clearly state and defend a position regarding \u0026ldquo;engaged scholarship\u0026rdquo;, and articulate the relationship of your argument to the contemporary media landscape have a basic understanding of markup languages and their use in DH be able to make compelling use of media materials such as audio, video, and animation in historical arguments understand how to create simple historical maps, and have an opinion about the value of GIS in historical argument  Method There are many approaches to the digital humanities, all of them involving tools that are under rapid and iterative development. A given project is likely to require a substantial training period in the particular tools chosen by the principal investigators. It is therefore not possible for this course to provide an effective survey of \u0026ldquo;the\u0026rdquo; digital humanities toolkit. But learning tools is an essential skill for the digital humanist. So what should we do?\nAlmost every digital humanist will, at some point, need to do the following:\n read and edit HTML, CSS and Javascript debug running web pages using the browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in tools use a text editor to write code in any of several languages collaborate with peers using version control software, almost always git  Our emphasis is therefore on simple coding taught using standard tools that are available almost everywhere. Almost all of the software we use is Free or Open Source. You will learn very basic web development skills and slowly come to apply them to increasingly sophisticated (but still pretty simple!) historical questions. These baby steps will give you some sense of what skills a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; digital history project requires, and give you the tools you\u0026rsquo;ll need to teach yourself when you encounter new tools in the course of a project.\nACTION  Policies Tools Course assignments will require you to install software. All of the software we use is free, but it requires a laptop to run. A Chromebook unfortunately will not be sufficient. While it is in principle possible to do all of your assignments on the web or using a very basic text editor, I do not recommend that method, and will not offer technical support. If you don\u0026rsquo;t own a laptop, you should find a way to borrow one, or buy a cheap model on College St to use for the duration of the semester.\nI can offer help with the following\n   Tool On Mac On Windows On Linux     Real Webbrowser Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome Firefox and/or Chrome   Text Editor Atom Atom Atom   Bash Shell Environment Terminal (Built in) Git for Windows or Windows Subsystem for Linux gnome-terminal, qterm, etc   Git Version Control Git for OSX Git for Windows apt-get install git   Git Visualization gitKraken gitKraken gitKraken   Github Org Membership Sign up here Sign up here Sign up here   Node and NPM Node Website (guide) Node Website (guide) Node Website (distro instructions)    Please see the Setup page for more details about the particular tools we will be using. YOU WILL ABSOLUTEY NEED TO HAVE THESE TOOLS IN ORDER TO TAKE THE COURSE\nCourse Requirements \u0026amp; Grading The assignments in this course take a wide variety of forms, and for the most part, differ significantly from what you\u0026rsquo;re likely to have encountered in other History courses. If you have little technical experience, or have perhaps ended up in this course by accident (!), you may find some of the work daunting at first. I have done my very best to make the assignments feasible for beginners, but you will likely encounter some difficult moments. I therefore strongly urge you to (1) start early! and (2) persevere through the difficult initial stages. The frustration you experience is, in fact, part of pedagogical method here. You are not expected to become a coding ninja, but learning how to learn is a major component of work in the Digital Humanities.\nBe warned! Marking in this course is unusual!\nGrading in this course is done using a modified point system. The system may seem odd at first, but it has definite advantages for both students and teachers, so don\u0026rsquo;t be intimidated. Instead of receiving a number or letter grade for each assignment, and then getting a weighted sum of those grades as your final mark, you will choose what final mark to try for and then complete the assignments required for that mark. A certain set of assignments is required for a D; for a C, you must complete all of the \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; assignments plus another set; for a B, all of the C assignments plus some more; and the same goes for an A.\nHere are some more details:\n All Assignments Are Graded Pass/Fail: Each assignment you get will include a careful explanation of my expectations. If your work meets those expectations, you get full credit; if not you get no credit. A \u0026lsquo;Passing\u0026rsquo; Mark on Assignments is a B+: In order to get credit for an assignment, you will have to demonstrate a high level of mastery \u0026#x2013; about the level normally required for a B+. Each Higher Grade Represents a quantum level of additional achievement: As you move up the ladder, assignments test more advanced and difficult concepts from the course. If you fail, you can try again: You start the semester with 5 \u0026lsquo;retry\u0026rsquo; chits, which you can use to resubmit assignments that have not succeeded. If necessary, you can use all of those chits on a single assignment! Resubmission process must be completed withing 1 week of the return date of the original version. A late assignment costs one \u0026lsquo;retry\u0026rsquo; chit: There is no percentage penalty for late work; instead, a late paper will cost you one of your retry opportunities. Second and third tries get fewer comments: I will give substantial comments on first tries; additional tries will get less and less fulsome commentary. Pluses and Minuses are determined by participation: The only part of your grade which is not determined on a pass/fail basis is the \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; part, which is assigned based on your on and offline participation. See the participation grade sheet for more details.  I know there will be questions! Please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to ask them. And here, finally, is the list of assignments. Detailed assignments will be handed out with adequate time to permit completion.\n   Assignment Due Date Brief Description A B C D     Git \u0026amp; Github Jan. 15 version control and collaboration \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark;   HTML \u0026amp; CSS Jan. 26 web markup and presentaiton \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark;   Javascript for DH Feb. 02 intro to programming \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark;   Data-Driven History Feb. 16  \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark;    Spatial History Mar. 02 Simple GIS Web project \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark;     Oral History Mar. 16 Multimedia Web Project \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark; \u0026checkmark;   Project Proposal Mar. 23 Imagine a Digital History Project \u0026checkmark;                Texts The following texts are required and available at the Bookstore, or via various online booksellers:\n Moretti, Franco.
