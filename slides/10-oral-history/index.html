CJ Minard (1781-1870); civil engineer; drawn in 1869; 
 six different dimensions: latitude, longitude, direction of movement, time, temperature, and the size of the Grand Army. Minard's achievement here is expertly illustrating a complex, multivariate time-space story in a compelling and concise display. Tufte has famously endorsed it as the “best statistical graphic ever drawn.” 11  E.J. Marey, a contemporary of Minard, praised the map as “seeming to defy the pen of the historian by its brutal eloquence.” 1
</p>

<p>
"The numbers of men present are represented by the widths of the colored zones in a rate of one millimeter for ten thousand men; these are also written beside the zones. Red designates men moving into Russia, black those on retreat. — The informations used for drawing the map were taken from the works of Messrs. Thiers, de Ségur, de Fezensac, de Chambray and the unpublished diary of Jacob, pharmacist of the Army since 28 October.
In order to facilitate the judgement of the eye regarding the diminution of the army, I supposed that the troops under Prince Jèrôme and under Marshal Davoust, who were sent to Minsk and Mobilow and who rejoined near Orscha and Witebsk, had always marched with the army."

<blockquote>
<p>
The first thing that makes oral history different, therefore, is that it tells us
less about events than about their meaning&#x2026;
Oral sources are credible but with a different credibility. The importance of
oral testimony may lie not in its adherence to fact, but rather in its departure
from it, as imagination, symbolism, and desire emerge. (Portelli)

<b>Interviewee:</b> I practically had a nervous breakdown when I discovered my sister had cancer, you know; it was kind of like knocking the pins [out from under me] &#x2013; and I had, after the second boy was born, I just had ill health for quite a few years. I evidently had a low-grade blood infection or something. Because I was very thin, and, of course, I kept working hard. And every fall, why, I'd generally spend a month or so being sick &#x2013; from overdoing, probably.
