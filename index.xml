      <description>General Description If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for History, Please, follow that link!
One of the hardest parts of this course for many people is setting up their working environment. In this assignment you will be need to set up your working environment and then use Git, much as we did in class, but this time manipulating the command line.
This may take longer than you think, and it&amp;rsquo;s due soon. Please get started soon by following the instructions on the Assignment 0 website.</description>

      <description>Due Date: Jan. 26
General Description You do not have to become a coder to do well in this course. However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this second assignment, we&amp;rsquo;ll use one of the web&amp;rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work. We&amp;rsquo;ll then extend that knowledge with a set of slightly more advanced programming exercises.</description>

      <guid>https://digitalhistory.github.io/dh-website/assignment/03-spatial-history/</guid>
      <description>Due Date: March 02
In class, we made a kind of toy Google Map out of hand-coded HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You will remember it from the course website, from JSBin, and from Github.
Your next assignment builds directly from that in-class exercise, and should be quite a bit easier to manage, technically, than your last assignment. Essentially, you will repeat the in-class assignment with much greater intellectual effort, but using the same technical framework.</description>

      <description>Due Date: April 02
For your final assignment, respond to the following call for proposals with an application approximately 2000 words in length, plus a provisional budget in the form of a spreadsheet (includea PDF, or provide a link to a viewable google sheet) or Markdown table. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice Google Sheets Extension that will convert a Google sheet to markdown for you.
See below for details.
Call for Proposals: Digital History Initiative Grants The Hacking History Foundation is pleased to announce a new Digital History Initiative, intended to advance the field of digital historical studies in Canada.</description>

      <description>As described in the syllabus, I use your participation mark to determine the &amp;ldquo;-/null/+&amp;rdquo; part of your grade. Let me explain a little more explicitly how this works.
The System It&amp;rsquo;s simple. Suppose you successfully complete the Git &amp;amp; Github, HTML &amp;amp; CSS, Javascript, Spatial History, and Oral History assignments. Congratulations! You have qualified for a B. But what kind of a B?
   If your class participation was: You get a: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor B- 72   Satisfactory B 75   Excellent B+ 78    Similarly, perhaps you were only able to complete the Git &amp;amp; Github, HTML &amp;amp; CSS, Javascript and Oral History.</description>

      <description>Well the first assignment is done. Whew! There were some common git issues that came up, and I hope we can cut back on them by documenting them here.
Learn how to navigate! The command line is very new to everyone, and I did a lousy job of explaining how to traverse the filesystem from the terminal. I have now posted some instructions that should help with this. Pro tip: in both Windows and Mac, you can open a terminal/git-bash window by right clicking on a location and clicking the &amp;ldquo;terminal here&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bash window here&amp;rdquo; buttons (screenshots anyone?</description>

      <title>Installing Node Dependencies</title>

      <description>Node.js is an exquisite piece of programming infrastructure. One of its main features is support for developer-defined dependencies. As a programmer &amp;ndash; or in my case, as a teacher &amp;ndash; you can inform the underlying node package manager (npm) that your project &amp;ldquo;depends&amp;rdquo; on some group of other projects. This allows programmers to build constantly on each other&amp;rsquo;s work.
In our assignments, node dependencies are mostly used to enable the tests, whose main function is to help you figure out whether you&amp;rsquo;ve done the assignments correctly.</description>

      <description>The Programming Historian link below is excellent. Having some trouble with screenshots ATM, will fix soon as I can reload my desktop &amp;ndash; but for next few hours pls refer to the PH link for images!
One common issue for people new to the command line is that it can be tough to understand the notion of location in the filesystem. Most ordinary users interact with their filesystems through the so-called GUI layer &amp;ndash; the graphical interface of windows.</description>

      <description>For the duration of this course, you will need to set up a &amp;ldquo;development environment&amp;rdquo; to do your work. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to download,install, and interact with a group of programs and services that make it possible to do your work. Setting your environment up can be difficult, so be sure to budget some time to do so! Also be aware that these tools will take up significant spae on your laptop and may cause your laptop to slow down somewhat if run simultaneously with</description>

      <description>You may find it useful, as you prepare for the next assignment, to read the following post!
What is Popcorn Popcorn is a Javascript &amp;ldquo;libary&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; a small collection of programs &amp;ndash; that lets web designers key events in a web page to a time-code in a media file. So essentially ,popcorn lets you &amp;ldquo;cue up&amp;rdquo; content ad display it only during fixed periods, while a media element is playing.</description>
