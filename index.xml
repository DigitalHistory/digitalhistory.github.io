      <description>Table of Contents  Assignment Getting your assignment, and handing it in Learning Objectives Expectations    Due Date: March 03
In class, we made a kind of toy Google Map out of hand-coded HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You will remember it from the course website, from JSBin, and from Github.
Your next assignment builds directly from that in-class exercise, and should be quite a bit easier to manage, technically, than your last assignment.</description>

You do not have to become a coder to do well in this course. However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this initial assignment, we&amp;rsquo;ll use one of the web&amp;rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work.</description>
