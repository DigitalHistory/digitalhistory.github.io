General Description You do not have to become a coder to do well in this course. However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this second assignment, we&amp;rsquo;ll use one of the web&amp;rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work. We&amp;rsquo;ll then extend that knowledge with a set of slightly more advanced programming exercises.</description>

      <title>Quick JSON tips</title>

      <description>Just a few words about JSON format. The format of the assignments JSON file will make more sense after we&amp;rsquo;ve learned a little bit of JavaScript (in the next 3 weeks). For this assignment I&amp;rsquo;m not really asking you to understand the format, but you do have to obey the syntax rules or the assignment tests will fail. JSON is a portable data format used for moving data from one source to another.</description>

      <description>For the duration of this course, you will need to set up a &amp;ldquo;development environment&amp;rdquo; to do your work. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to download, install, and interact with a group of programs and services that make it possible to do your work. Setting your environment up can be difficult, so be sure to budget some time to do so! Also be aware that these tools will take up significant spae on your laptop and may cause your laptop to slow down somewhat if run simultaneously with</description>

      <description>General Description If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for History, Please, follow that link! Your job in this assignment is to tell the class a few things about yourself. In the process we&amp;rsquo;ll think about a few issues related to digital storage of information, including privacy, interpretation of sources, and data vs. knowledge.
One of the hardest parts of this course for many people is setting up their working environment. In this assignment you will be need to set up your working environment and then use Git, much as we did in class, but this time manipulating the command line.</description>

      <title>Using VSCode</title>

      <description>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Visual Studio Code is an amazing general-purpose code editor. Most people I collaborate with use it as their primary editor, and that will be true in most professional settings you enter. This is the first year we&amp;rsquo;re using it in the class, and I have some high hopes for it.
As with any powerful tool, it can take a little while to get comfortable with VSCode. The documentation is excellent, but may sometimes assume more advanced programming skills than you have.</description>

      <title>Understanding Popcorn</title>

      <description>You may find it useful, as you prepare for the next assignment, to read the following post!
What is Popcorn Popcorn is a Javascript &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; – a small collection of programs – that lets web designers key events in a web page to a time-code in a media file. So essentially, popcorn lets you &amp;ldquo;cue up&amp;rdquo; content ad display it only during fixed periods, while a media element is playing. If you then pause or manually rewind/fast-forward the media element (audio or video), the events will also reset to the appropriate time.</description>

      <description>Resources There are many, many excellent JavScript resources on the web. I strongly recommend the MDN JavaScript Learning Pathway. I also have a very high opinion of Eloquent Javascript, but in past years students have often found it somewhat difficult. However, it rewards careful study, teaches excellent habits, and encourages creative thinking while coding. Both MDN and EJ have built-in JS Consoles forexperimenting with code (see below).
MDN also has a more advanced guide to JavaScript which starts with this &amp;ldquo;reintroduction&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>As described in the syllabus, I use your participation mark to determine the &amp;ldquo;-/null/+&amp;rdquo; part of your grade. Let me explain a little more explicitly how this works.
The System It&amp;rsquo;s simple. Suppose you successfully complete all the main assignments, but decide not to write a Project Proposal. Congratulations! You have qualified for a B. But what kind of a B?
   If your class participation was: You get a: Which ROSI will show as:     Poor B- 72   Satisfactory B 75   Excellent B+ 78    Similarly, perhaps you were only able to complete the Git &amp;amp; Github, HTML &amp;amp; CSS, Javascript and Oral History.</description>

      <title>Navigating at the Command Line</title>

      <description>The Programming Historian link below is excellent. Having some trouble with screenshots ATM, will fix soon as I can reload my desktop – but for next few hours pls refer to the PH link for images!
One common issue for people new to the command line is that it can be tough to understand the notion of location in the filesystem. Most ordinary users interact with their filesystems through the so-called GUI layer – the graphical interface of windows.</description>

      <title>Installing Node Dependencies</title>

      <description>Node.js is an exquisite piece of programming infrastructure. One of its main features is support for developer-defined dependencies. As a programmer – or in my case, as a teacher – you can inform the underlying node package manager (npm) that your project &amp;ldquo;depends&amp;rdquo; on some group of other projects. This allows programmers to build constantly on each other&amp;rsquo;s work.
In our assignments, node dependencies are mostly used to enable the tests, whose main function is to help you figure out whether you&amp;rsquo;ve done the assignments correctly.</description>
