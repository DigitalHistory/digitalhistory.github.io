      <description>One of the hardest parts of this course for many people is setting up their working environment. In this assignment you will be need to set up your working environment &amp;lt;../../tools/setup&amp;gt; and then use Git, much as we did in class, but this time manipulating the command line.
This may take longer than you think, and it&amp;rsquo;s due soon. Please get started soon by following the instructions on the Assignment 0 website.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Assignment    Due Date: Jan. 26
You do not have to become a coder to do well in this course. However, you will have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar. In this second assignment, we&amp;rsquo;ll use one of the web&amp;rsquo;s many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Assignment Getting your assignment, and handing it in Learning Objectives Expectations    Due Date: March 02
In class, we made a kind of toy Google Map out of hand-coded HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You will remember it from the course website, from JSBin, and from Github.
Your next assignment builds directly from that in-class exercise, and should be quite a bit easier to manage, technically, than your last assignment.</description>
